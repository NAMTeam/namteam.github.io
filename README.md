# SC4NAM Simplification Project

Consolidating through simplifying the website is the main goal with this project. 
Introducing a new "Getting Started" section provides simplicity to what is strictly necessary information for most users. 
The Reference section is now reserved for material to be called only when needed.

There are currently no changes to the Feature Guides or newly re-titled "Technical Data" sections. 

"Getting Started" button on homepage is broken in this version. This is temporary until committing.
