Read more Before you run off in excitement to install the new NAM version, please make sure to read this (short) document first, to ensure the best Network Addon Mod experience.
Also, make sure you have the following installed:
Java Runtime Environment (available from AdoptOpenJDK\u0026ndash;a 64-bit Windows copy of JRE 11 is enclosed in the download) Note: in order to ensure proper installation of NAM releases using the current installer, please remove the \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod\u0026rdquo; folder (and if still present, \u0026ldquo;z___NAM\u0026rdquo; folder) from the Plugins directory (usually My Documents\\SimCity 4\\Plugins on Windows) before installing a new NAM version. The Cleanup/Cleanitol functionality is not presently designed to remove full NAM installations.
If you wish to only install the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Traffic Simulator Plugin, we recommend that rather than installing the NAM itself, that you load up the included Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT), which is contained within the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool folder in the download.
New Features for NAM 44 # Hybrid Railway (HRW) Features: The Hybrid Railway system now features FA-2 Alt content, new textures to blend with the RealRailway (RRW) system, improvements to catenaries, and major improvements to Left-Hand Drive [LHD] support. RealHighway (RHW) x Avenue Features: The RealHighway (RHW) now has a FlexDDI system, allowing for FLEX-based Diverging Diamond interchanges with the Avenue network at ground level, and L1 and L2 elevations. Additionally, the FlexSPUI system now supports the L1 height level for the Type 120/Avenue configuration, along with stability improvements for all height levels. Both of these FLEX-based items can be found under a new button on the Roads menu. Additionally, the Avenue Type A1 and B1 MIS Ramp Interfaces have received draggable forms, following the same basic drag patterns as the RHW Type A1 and B1 Ramp Interfaces. RealHighway (RHW) Curves: new 90° draggable Mini-Curves have been added. The new 3x3 R1 90° Curves support the ground-level RHW-2, RHW-3, RHW-4, and MIS Ramp networks. The new 4x4 R1.5 90° Curves support the ground-level RHW-2, RHW-3, RHW-4, RHW-6S, and MIS Ramp networks. The RHW-6S also now supports the 5x5 R2 90° Curve configuration. MIS Ramp network support has been added to the FLEX S-Curve, and minor aesthetic improvements have been made to the L1 and above RHW-4 FLEX S-Curves. RealHighway (RHW) Transitions: 45° Curved FLEX Height Transitions at the R3 radius have been added, covering the RHW-2 (L0-L1), RHW-4 (L0-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4), and MIS Ramp (L0-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4) networks. Diagonal FLEX OnSlope (FLEX-OST) support has been added for the RHW-3 and RHW-6S networks. Additionally, further adjacency stability has been added to the 4x4 90° Curved FLEX Height Transitions. Bridges: New Viaduct Bridges have been added for Avenue (L0, L1, and L2), RHW-8S and RHW-10S (L1 and L2), and RealRailway (L0, L1, L2 for double track, L0 and L1 for single track). Flexible Turn Lane (FTL) Features: FLEX-based FTL Height Transitions have been added, including for the Type 120 Avenue (Ascending, L0-L1 and L0-L2\u0026ndash;use the FLEX Pieces for ramp-style transitions, or drag the FTL setup into the ground end of the On-Slope Transitions to transition the turn lanes to elevation), and RealHighway MIS-2 Lane (Descending, L1-L0, with FLEX Pieces for ramp-style transitions) configurations. Limited L1 and L2 Type 120 Avenue FTL support has been added (primarily for connecting to the L1 and L2 FlexSPUI). The Type 230 configuration for the Triple-Tile Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks has received draggable support for rail-type crossings, including Rail (both Dual and Single-Track), L1 and L2 Rail Viaducts, Standard and Rural Ground Light Rail (GLR), Elevated (Light) Rail, and Monorail. The MIS 2-Lane configuration has also received support for Avenue + and T-intersections (without FTLs), and One-Way Road intersections (with SITAP\u0026ndash;Signalization and Turn Arrow Project\u0026ndash;support, using the appropriate FLEX intersections). Additionally, Avenues can now end at T-intersections with the Road/NWM Type 110 configuration, with turn arrows provided by the new Avenue Type 020 FTLs. Streets and the Street Addon Mod (SAM): The draggable Diagonal S-Curves now work for SAM Sets 2 through 11. Network Widening Mod (NWM) x Street Addon Mod (SAM): Adjacency support for the Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks\u0026rsquo; intersections with the Street Addon Mod (SAM) sets has been vastly improved. FLEX Overpasses: The Road, One-Way Road (OWR), and Avenue networks have now received FLEX Overpasses, which allow for prefabricated orthogonal viaduct overcrossings of 1-4 tiles to be built. The length can be selected by using Home and End to rotate the overpass. Simply drag any orthogonal network underneath the FLEX Overpasses to cross below them. RHW Disconnector/NAM Eraser: The RHW Disconnector Tool has been rechristened the NAM Eraser, reflecting its ability to erase 1x1 network tiles of any network or network crossing combination. Additionally, it is also now available on all network menus. User Interface: The NAM\u0026rsquo;s menu buttons have been reworked, providing a cleaner image and, to improve internationalization (i18n), the English text has been removed from the icons themselves. The buttons have also been reordered, in an effort to improve the overall experience. Additionally, the old puzzle piece-based overpasses have been related to legacy status. Left-Hand Drive Support: Various improvements have been made across the board to LHD pathing. Morifari Victorian Stations: The Morifari Victorian Stations for Elevated Light Rail and Rail Viaducts have been restored, with some associated bugs fixed. Other Bugfixes: The RHW-10S will no longer flip improperly under Elevated RealRailway (ERRW) crossings. Diagonal x Diagonal (DxD) crossings involving the MIS Ramp and RHW-8C network have been improved. Pathing issues on the RHW-6C and RHW-8C FLEX Neighbor Connections have been addressed. Fixed the Euro textures on the RHW-6S Type A2 Wide ramp. The extraneous arrows on the RHW-2-to-4 and RHW-4-to-6C FLEX Width Transitions in LHD have been addressed. Drag-through issues involving the Triple-Tile-Thru x Dual-Tile-End FLEX T-intersections in the Flexible Turn Lanes (FTLs) have been fixed. Requirements and Compatibility # The Network Addon Mod, in its current form with default installation options, is designed to run on systems with a 64-bit operating system and at least 4GB RAM. Most modern systems should be able to comfortably run the mod. By installing fewer options and using the \u0026ldquo;LowRAM/NoRHW\u0026rdquo; Controller options (or the Controller Compiler to manually compile a custom smaller NAM Controller), however, it is possible to run the NAM on 32-bit operating systems, and/or systems with 4GB or less RAM. At least 1.2GB of hard drive space is required, in order to fully unpack the installer, but actual installation size may run from as little as 1.7MB to as much as 1.2GB, depending on the options chosen and if one selects to manually run the Controller Compiler after installation.
Note, however, that Windows users attempting to run the \u0026ldquo;Full/4GB\u0026rdquo; Controller options without the 4GB Patch, on a 32-bit version of Windows, and/or have less than 4GB RAM, that the game will crash to desktop (CTD) upon attempting to load a city. Following the proper installation procedure will avoid this issue.
The Network Addon Mod is compatible with the following versions of the game:
A) Retail Windows digital copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe OR SimCity 4 with the Rush Hour Expansion Pack (Version 1.1.641), from all digital retailers except Origin (i.e. GOG.com, Steam). B) Retail Windows disc copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe OR SimCity 4 with the Rush Hour Expansion Pack, updated to at least Version 1.1.638 (note that disc copies do not run on Windows 10). C) Digital Windows copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe obtained redeeming an existing CD key (not purchasing) through Origin Customer Support. D) Retail Mac digital copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe, purchased through Steam, or, if running macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or earlier, the App Store version. E) Retail Mac disc copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe, running on macOS/OS X Version 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or earlier. (NOTE: Platform-specific technical support for the NAM on macOS is extremely limited.) The Network Addon Mod is NOT compatible with the following versions of the game:
F) Retail disc copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe OR SimCity 4 with the Rush Hour Expansion Pack that have not been patched (Version 1.1.610 or 1.1.613). G) Retail Windows digital copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe purchased from Origin. H) Copies utilized as part of EA Play (formerly Origin Access)/Xbox Game Pass. I) The App Store version of the Mac port, if running on macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later. J) Retail disc copies of non-Deluxe SimCity 4 (sometimes marketed later as \u0026ldquo;SimCity 4 Classic\u0026rdquo;), without the Rush Hour Expansion Pack (Version 1.0.272 or earlier) K) Pirated or cracked copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe OR SimCity 4 with the Rush Hour Expansion Pack. What should I do if the NAM does not support my copy of the game?
The new NAM installer (introduced with the NAM 37 Release Candidate) no longer runs a version check. However, it is strongly recommended that users check the version they are running, as unpatched copies can be unstable. Version 1.1.610 and Version 1.1.613 are NOT supported. In Case F, the solution is simply to install the EP1 Update 1 patch, which can be downloaded from EA (SKU 1-5), SimCity 4 Devotion (SKU 1-5), or Simtropolis (SKU 1 and 2 only). To determine the correct SKU version for your copy of SimCity 4, find the installation directory, and look in the subfolder named sku_data. Alternatively, one can simply try all the SKU versions of the patch, until one works.
For Case G and H, see the section about Origin below.
For Case I, changes Apple made to the \u0026ldquo;sandboxing\u0026rdquo; system with macOS 11 (Big Sur) have effectively made it impossible to play the App Store version with any kind of mods or plugins. We recommend you seek a refund and instead purchase the Steam version of the macOS port. Users still running the App Store version on macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or earlier should still be able to install the mod, though with more difficulty than the Steam version, due to the reliance on sandboxing. See the section about macOS here.
For Cases J and K, it is recommended that you purchase a digital copy of SimCity 4 Deluxe (NOT from Origin).
What if my disc copy has simply stopped working with Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, or 10?
Microsoft decided in 2015 that secdrv.sys, the driver file used by the SafeDisc and other disc copy protection systems present in many PC games from the early 2000s, was a security threat. As a result, the driver was not included as part of Windows 10, and Microsoft issued a Windows Update, KB3086255, which disables secdrv.sys on Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1. In the case of the older versions of Windows, secdrv.sys can be re-enabled when needed through the use of the command prompt or a batch file.
Aside from the advanced step of manually signing a device driver for Windows 10, the only viable courses of action are to either purchase a retail digital copy of the game (NOT from Origin), or to redeem your CD key at no cost via Origin Customer Support (which, unlike purchasing from Origin, will result in you receiving a properly-patched version of SimCity 4 Deluxe).
Note that cracked executables (i.e. a \u0026ldquo;No CD\u0026rdquo; .exe) are not eligible for tech support. The NAM Team does not support piracy, but understands the frustration with the game\u0026rsquo;s original DRM system being blocked by Microsoft, forcing one to buy a new digital copy in order to continue playing. However, the reason why cracked executables are not eligible is for more practical reasons, namely the potential for version mismatches (i.e. a Version 1.1.638 crack with Version 1.1.610/613 .DAT files, or vice-versa), which can greatly complicate the team\u0026rsquo;s efforts to provide useful technical support to users. The Origin issues played a role in our keeping the version check in place, until the recent installer change in 2020.
Please note that if you are attempting to use an older, 32-bit version of Windows (i.e. Windows XP) in order to still run your disc game, this will substantially hamper the performance of the game with the full NAM installed, and it is highly recommended that you run the game on a 64-bit operating system. If you must run on a 32-bit OS, you will need to either select one of the \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; NAM Controller options, or manually run the Controller Compiler and install a smaller feature set. (The RealHighway (RHW) system is by far the largest part of the NAM.)
Various Important Notes # Note that the NTCore 4GB Patch is REQUIRED if you are running the Full NAM Controller (\u0026ldquo;4GB Full\u0026rdquo; options in the installer), which is required to use the RealHighway (RHW) system. If the installation procedure is begun via NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version42.bat, as is the new recommended procedure, the 4GB Patch should be automatically applied to the game. Otherwise, the patch can be found inside the download, or downloaded directly from NTCore here, where further instructions on use of the patch can be found. Also due to this installer change, the NAM Controller Compiler is no longer run as part of the installation process. Users will have an option to install one of two pre-built NAM Controller options, the Full \u0026ldquo;4GB\u0026rdquo; option, which has a substantial size and requires the 4GB Patch and a 64-bit operating system, or a \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; version that does not require the 4GB Patch, and does not include the code for the RealHighway (RHW) system, the most expansive fetaure in the mod. The \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; version should be used by those with 32-bit operating systems (i.e. Windows XP), less than 4GB RAM, and/or by those not using the RHW. Users wishing for further customization of NAM Controller size can still run the Controller Compiler manually, as it is available in the download.
Users wishing to simply use the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Traffic Simulator improvements should skip the main NAM Installation and instead load up the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT), which is in the folder of the same name. The tool itself is \u0026ldquo;TSCT.jar\u0026rdquo;, though may be easier to open using the batch file (\u0026ldquo;TSCT.bat\u0026rdquo;). Note that the TSCT also requires the Java Runtime Environment.
The NAM uses a Java-based installer, designed by daeley, which is cross-platform (meaning no more separate Mac versions, and Linux support without WINE). As such, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is now REQUIRED to run the NAM installer. It was previous recommended for users wishing to utilize the NAM Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT). A Windows 64-bit copy of OpenJDK 11 is included in the download (OpenJDK11U-jre_x64_windows_hotspot_11.0.8_10.msi). Other open source distributions of Java can be downloaded from here.
Users who fundamentally object to installing Java (or are unable to for other reasons) can perform a manual install, with patience. Details can be found here
With the new installer, the old NAM installation is no longer removed automatically, so users should manually remove the \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;z___NAM\u0026rdquo; folders from their Plugins directory. If you use the \u0026ldquo;Cleanup\u0026rdquo; option under the \u0026ldquo;Setup\u0026rdquo; tab, it is highly recommended that you select the \u0026ldquo;Backup\u0026rdquo; option upon completion, and \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; will in fact delete all those files, making them unrecoverable. It is recommended, particularly with this Release Candidate, that you back those folders up in a location that is not in your Plugins folder. The \u0026ldquo;z___NAM\u0026rdquo; folder has been eliminated, and all files are now installed to the \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod\u0026rdquo; directory.
The RealRailway (RRW) standard for Rail is now the default and only option. One may choose to disable the RRW\u0026rsquo;s more restrictive default slope settings by unselecting the \u0026ldquo;RRW Tunnel and Slope Parameters\u0026rdquo; box in the installer. The original Maxis Rail specification will be supported via a Legacy Plugin, downloaded separately, at a later date. Also note that a number of cosmetic-oriented NAM plugins, such as the El-Rail Alternate Implementation, the Bullet Train Mod, and some advanced texture options (largely deprecated) have been removed from the installer. The Alternate El-Rail and BTM will be made available separately at a later date. Please note that, much like Maxis Rail, these Plugins are effectively in \u0026ldquo;Legacy\u0026rdquo; status, and may not be actively maintained or supported by the NAM Team going forward. Both the original Maxis Highways (MHW) and the \u0026ldquo;Maxis Highway Override/Project Symphony\u0026rdquo; (MHO) remain available.
The Station Locator, Updater, and Reconstruction Project (SLURP) is also no longer handled by the new installer. A scaled down version of the old installer will be made at a later date to handle SLURP routines. Users wishing to retain SLURPed stations should retrieve them from the \u0026ldquo;z___NAM\\Mass Transit Lots\\Station Overrides\u0026rdquo; folder in their existing NAM installation, where they will be found in the \u0026ldquo;Mass Transit Lots\u0026rdquo; subfolder. Note that users running the 64-bit version of SimCity 4 on macOS may wish to refrain from retrieving SLURP stations, as there have been some encoding issues with stations that cause that version of the game to CTD.
The new installer also no longer performs a version check. Please note, however, that for Windows users, Version 1.1.638 and above are still required, as Versions 1.1.610 and 1.1.613 have notable instabilities that may have a significant negative impact on the use of this mod. Copies purchased from the Origin Store may still not meet this requirement, and support will not be offered to users with \u0026ldquo;unofficial\u0026rdquo; copies of the game.
Notice to Users Who Purchased a Digital Copy from Origin, or Use EA Play or Xbox Game Pass # Aside from a brief period in 2014-2015, Origin, the digital retail platform run by Electronic Arts (EA), has been selling defective copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe to retail customers. As of the release of NAM 44, this appears to still be the case. Unlike the retail versions sold by GOG.com, Steam, and Amazon (the \u0026ldquo;Thin Game Download\u0026rdquo; version), which come pre-patched to Version 1.1.641, the Origin retail copy is Version 1.1.610. By virtue of switching out the original SafeDisc copy protection for their own DRM, Origin altered the checksum of the game\u0026rsquo;s executable, which prevents the EP1 Update 1 patcher\u0026ndash;a piece of software they made\u0026ndash;from running. This not only prevents the NAM from being installed, but leaves Origin retail copies with all the bugs that the developers fixed in 2003. It also prevents first-party content creation tools like the Building Architect Tool (BAT) from being installed. In effect, the Origin retail copy is unpatched and unpatchable.
Since the EA Play (formerly Origin Access) service, which is included as part of Xbox Game Pass, utilizes Origin files, users playing SimCity 4 Deluxe through either of these services are also presently saddled with the unpatchable/unpatched Version 1.1.610.
For those who have purchased the game via the Origin Store, the NAM Team recommends you contact Origin Customer Support about obtaining a refund, even after the return period has expired, as users have had success in this case. If you are among the users who are saddled with the unpatched and unpatchable Origin retail version, the team would also appreciate hearing from you, as we have a strong desire to see Origin give their customers a properly-patched copy of the game, and are trying to document just how many users are affected. Those playing via EA Play/Xbox Game Pass should also let EA Play know that they are serving up a defective copy of the game.
Strangely, copies obtained by redeeming an existing CD key at no cost with Origin Customer Support (Case C) are properly patched, despite what the same support team routinely tells those who bought copies and received defective Version 1.1.610 digital copies.
In short:
Free copy from Origin Support for CD Key Redemption: Properly patched (1.1.641) Purchased copy from Origin Store, or playing via EA Play (formerly Origin Access)/Xbox Game Pass: Unpatched and unpatchable (1.1.610) For a more detailed assessment of the Origin situation, NAM developer Tarkus has written extensively on the subject at his blog, SimTarkus.
Note to Mac Users # Aspyr recently issued an update to their port of SimCity 4 Deluxe for macOS, updating it from a 32-bit app to a 64-bit one on both Steam and the App Store, allowing it to be compatible with macOS Catalina (10.15) and later. This change has introduced a number of quirks, however.
As of macOS 11 (Big Sur), changes to the operating system\u0026rsquo;s handling of \u0026ldquo;sandboxing\u0026rdquo; means that the App Store version of the game no longer supports mods.
Most notably, it has changed the key combination for cycling through TAB Loops under the NAM\u0026rsquo;s various buttons. Instead of using TAB to move forward, and Shift-TAB to move in reverse, Mac users must now use Ctrl-TAB to move forward, and Ctrl-Shift-TAB to move in reverse. While TAB and Shift-TAB will allow one to move through the TAB Loop, these keys/combinations will cause some pieces under the buttons to be skipped.
Furthermore, the changes have also broken simmaster07\u0026rsquo;s SC4MacInjector, which allowed DLL plugins\u0026ndash;including SC4Fix.dll (which addressed the puzzle piece/TE Lot CTDs)\u0026ndash;to run on macOS. As such, these fixes no longer work on Mac, and users should exercise caution when placing stations in the vicinity of static puzzle pieces.
Additionally, the installation procedure for the NAM varies depending on if one is using the Steam version or the App Store version.
With the Steam version, the NAM will install into the correct location by default: /Users/{username}/Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins/.
With the App Store version, after running the installer, move \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod\u0026rdquo; folder from the default install location to /Users/{username}/Library/Containers/com.aspyr.simcity4.appstore/Data/Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins/. Note again, however, that this only works on macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or earlier. The App Store version on macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later does not support mods.
Preparing to Install The NAM # When one initially opens the NAM package after downloading, there will be several items present, besides the document you are now reading: NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version42.jar, NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version42.bat, and NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version42.sh, all of which are part of the installation process (depending on your operating system), 4gb_patch.exe is the NTCore 4GB Patch, the Controller Compiler folder contains the NAM Controller Compiler, the Documentation is loose in the folder (and in the \u0026ldquo;feature-guides\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;images\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; folders), and the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool folder, which contains the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT).
Before beginning installation, regardless of operating system, remove your existing NAM installation, which will be located in the \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod\u0026rdquo; folder (and if installed pre-2020, may also include a \u0026ldquo;z___NAM\u0026rdquo; folder) inside your main Plugins directory. The Cleanup/Cleanitol tab in the installer is not presently set up to remove a full NAM installation, and cannot be relied upon to do so for you.
To begin installation, follow the directions for your operating system:
On Windows, open NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version42.bat. On Mac, open NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version42.jar. On Linux, open NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version42.sh. Simply dumping the files into your Plugins folder WILL NOT install the NAM\u0026ndash;you will get no new menu buttons, and will just slow down the game. The installer MUST be run, or the manual installation procedure must be followed. If you are on Windows, it is recommended that you If User Access Control (UAC) is enabled on your system, Windows may ask you to approve running the file with a simple \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo; prompt. Click \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; to allow the installer to run.
In order to progress through the installer, simply click on each tab. Note that the license agreement must be agreed to before subsequent tabs can be accessed. The \u0026ldquo;Cleanup\u0026rdquo; tab allows one to remove some residual files from old NAM releases, and pre-NAM transit mods that might cause conflicts, and is loaded with the old Cleanitol list that shipped with NAM 36. It is highly recommended that you choose the \u0026ldquo;Backup\u0026rdquo; option instead of \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; after doing so, as \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; will completely wipe out the files, as the label implies. Note that it presently is not capable of removing an entire NAM installation, which should be done manually prior to installing a new release.
For more details on the installation process and options, see the installation section of the NAM documentation.
Upgrading from a Previous Version # If you are upgrading from a previous version of the NAM, MANUALLY MOVE YOUR OLD NAM INSTALLATION OUT FROM YOUR PLUGINS FOLDER, INTO A SAFE LOCATION (note that this has changed from previous NAM releases).. The NAM installer can no longer detect your previous installation options by reading the existing folder structure. It is recommended that you check your existing installation, to determine which features you presently have installed.
Generally speaking, the NAM Team makes every effort to ensure that new versions at least retain some form of \u0026ldquo;legacy support\u0026rdquo;, such that cities built with any previous NAM version will continue to function well with the latest version.
If you have consolidated your NAM files using a tool such as SC4DatPacker or JDatPacker, please read here.
A Note About Drive Side (RHD vs. LHD) # While the NAM Installer, as noted above, has a series of checkboxes in Custom Installation relating to drive side, it is worth re-iterating that these boxes only change the compatibility files installed with the NAM, and do NOT change drive side. If you have an installation with Right-Hand Driving (RHD, vehicles driving on the right side of roads\u0026ndash;this concept is NOT the same as the side one sits on when driving a vehicle) and wish to switch to Left-Hand Driving (LHD, vehicles driving on the left side of roads), this generally needs to be done either by adjusting the game\u0026rsquo;s locale files, and then either editing the game\u0026rsquo;s Windows registry entries, or by modifying the game\u0026rsquo;s shortcut.
The new NAM Installer cannot determine default drive side of your installation, so make note of which side vehicles drive on in your game prior to installation. If you have changed your drive side by modifying the game\u0026rsquo;s shortcut, instead of editing the Windows registry, then this would be the one and only case when changing the box checked here would be needed.
A Note About the \u0026ldquo;4GB Patch\u0026rdquo; # Due to changes in computer systems, and continued expansions of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s main Controller file, in 2013, it was determined that many newer systems, particularly those with more than 4GB of RAM, and running 64-bit versions of Windows, need additional accommodation. To that end, the NAM includes a \u0026ldquo;4GB Patch\u0026rdquo;, also known as a \u0026ldquo;Large Address Aware (LAA) Patch\u0026rdquo;, which allows the game to access the full 4GB of RAM that a 32-bit application can read, instead of the default 2GB. The NAM\u0026rsquo;s patch was designed by NTCore, and built into the NAM with permission, and users with systems that need the patch will receive a prompt during NAM installation to install it. The original patch can be found here.
The only thing this patch does is to switch the Large Address Aware switch, an accessible switch present in all Windows executables, from \u0026ldquo;off\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; for the game\u0026rsquo;s executable. Patches like this are common in game modding communities, including those associated with Skyrim, Fallout, and Morrowind, and can be used to enhance any 32-bit application\u0026rsquo;s performance on systems with 64-bit operating systems and a suitable amount of RAM.
The new installation starting point for Windows users\u0026ndash; NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version42.bat\u0026ndash;should ensure that your game is automatically patched as needed.
Note that the 4GB Patch is NOT required for users on macOS, as that version of the game is 64-bit and can access more RAM than the Windows version (even with the 4GB Patch!) by default.
The default directory for where SimCity 4.exe may be located depends on how and where you purchased your copy of the game.
GOG.com: C:\\GOG Games\\SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition\\Apps Steam: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\SimCity 4 Deluxe\\Apps Original Disc: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Maxis\\SimCity 4 Deluxe\\Apps Origin*: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Maxis\\SimCity 4 Deluxe\\Apps *Note that only Origin copies acquired through Free CD Key Redemption (Version 1.1.641) are compatible with the NAM. Copies purchased through the Origin Store or accessed via Origin Access (Version 1.1.610) ARE NOT COMPATIBLE. See here for more details.
Running the Controller Compiler # If you are an advanced user, and would like to trim down your installation of the NAM, it is still possible to run the NAM Controller Compiler (a cross-platform application) after installing the NAM. Extract/open the \u0026ldquo;Controller Compiler\u0026rdquo; folder, and double-click the file \u0026ldquo;NAMControllerCompiler.jar\u0026rdquo;. Select the \u0026lsquo;input\u0026rsquo; folder \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod/Controller/\u0026rdquo; from the current \u0026ldquo;Controller Compiler\u0026rdquo; directory, and the \u0026lsquo;output\u0026rsquo; folder \u0026quot;~/Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins/Network Addon Mod/\u0026quot; inside your plugins. For the rest, follow the instructions of the compiler.
Regarding \u0026ldquo;DatPacking\u0026rdquo; and File Consolidation Post-Installation # Programs to consolidate folders worth of SimCity 4 .DAT files, such as SC4DatPacker (Windows) and JDatPacker (cross-platform), are popular options known to improve game performance, given SimCity 4\u0026rsquo;s preference to read a smaller number of larger files, instead of a larger number of small files\u0026ndash;a fact determined by the BSC Team\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Miramba Experiment\u0026rdquo; of 2006. The use of \u0026ldquo;DatPacking\u0026rdquo; programs on one\u0026rsquo;s NAM installation, however, is a controversial topic. The NAM Team\u0026rsquo;s general advice is for Windows users to avoid DatPacking (unless one is extremely careful, while for Mac users, the use of JDatPacker is virtually required.
In general, if one plans to DatPack one\u0026rsquo;s NAM installation, they should also save the pre-DatPacked NAM folder in a safe place, outside the Plugins folder beforehand. The reason for this is to avoid potential conflicts and issues, such as the \u0026ldquo;dual icon bug\u0026rdquo; and Controller file conflicts between new and old installations, as well as to make it such that one knows which options they have installed when upgrading to a new version, or re-installing the same version with different options.
In the case of the Aspyr port for the Mac platform (both App Store and Steam versions), it possesses a strange quirk in which exceeding a certain number of files or folders (regardless of size) in the Plugins folder can cause game slowdowns or even crashing-to-desktop (CTD). To this end, using JDatPacker after installing the NAM on a Mac is a necessity, in order to ensure proper game performance. Again, however, one should save their pre-DatPacked NAM installation in a safe place, outside the Plugins folder, to make for easy upgrades.
Uninstalling the NAM # To uninstall the files, simply bulldoze every NAM item from this download in your cities and remove the files from the Plugins folder afterwards, which will be contained in Plugins\\Network Addon Mod by default.
Changing Options After Initial Installation # The NAM is a very expansive mod, with a substantial number of features, which may initially prove overwhelming to those not well-versed in its workings. The NAM Team anticipates that users, particularly those new to the NAM, may want to change the feature set they have installed, as they learn more about the mod\u0026rsquo;s contents and capabilities.
To that end, we encourage users to keep the installer for the current version handy after initial installation. If you plan to change your particular set of options, you will need to remove your current installation. Moving it out of Plugins to a safe location is recommended, in case you want to keep your existing settings as a backup.
Manual Installation - Advanced # Users who are unable or unwilling to install Java can perform a manual installation of the NAM, something which the new file architecture introduced in 2020 makes far more possible than the previous \u0026ldquo;Monolithic\u0026rdquo; releases.
This method requires a file decompression tool capable of opening .jar files, such as 7-zip (Windows) or Keka (macOS). To begin, open NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version42.jar using your file decompression tool.
The NAM\u0026rsquo;s contents are located in the \u0026ldquo;installation\u0026rdquo; subfolder. The current installer uses a series of character flags at the start of directory names, in order to instruct the installer how to order the options, whether they\u0026rsquo;re mandatory or optional, etc.
Numbers preceded by the dollar sign (\u0026quot;\$\u0026quot;), i.e. \u0026ldquo;\$1\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;\$2\u0026rdquo;, etc., are merely being ordered with this flag.
Any directory with the caret (\u0026quot;^\u0026quot;) in front of the name (or behind a \u0026ldquo;\$\u0026rdquo; ordering flag) is mandatory.
Any directory with the exclamation mark (\u0026quot;!\u0026quot;) in front of the name (or behind a \u0026ldquo;\$\u0026rdquo; ordering flag) is not installed by default.
Any options where the equal sign (\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;) and the dash (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;) are present are mutually exclusive\u0026ndash;only one should be installed (the \u0026ldquo;=\u0026rdquo; option is the default).
The \u0026ldquo;\$1^Core\u0026rdquo; directory is required. All other folders have options within them. With \u0026ldquo;4_Automata Controller#\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;7_Texture and Drive Side Support\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;8_Traffic Simulator#\u0026rdquo;, simply select one of the options inside and discard the rest, as these are straight up mutually exclusive one another.
The Automata Controller basically affects the display of the visual traffic in-game\u0026ndash;Standard is going to be the lightest, while Radical is going to be the heaviest, Persistent makes the automata visuals last longer, and the 24-Hour modifiers handle whether the display is constant, or follows the data for the 24-Hour clock in-game.
The Texture and Drive Side Support includes four options, depending on whether you want to use US/North American textures or Euro/International Textures, and the drive side of your game (RHD or LHD, which should match your selection for the NAM Controller).
With the Traffic Simulator, these are ordered by the \u0026ldquo;\$1\u0026rdquo; and the like in order of lowest capacity option to highest. Medium is the default.
With 5_DataView Options#, there\u0026rsquo;s two subfolders. Both are just straight up options, with nothing mutually exclusive. You can probably just leave this one as is, unless you really don\u0026rsquo;t like the Data View changes.
With 6_Miscellaneous, the two mutually exclusive options to watch out for are Extended Station Queries (there\u0026rsquo;s four options in there\u0026ndash;very subtle differences between them), and Maxis Transit Lots\\Airport Capacity Adjustment#, which has three options (Default, Medium, and Large). And the Hole Diggers and Raisers are very much recommended\u0026ndash;they have lots of use outside regular NAM usage, too.
With 3_Additional Transit Stations, this depends on if you want more transit stations beyond the game\u0026rsquo;s default, and what the NAM adds by default for certain additional override networks. There should be no harm in either adding this one in whole, or leaving it out altogether, and if there\u0026rsquo;s certain added stations you like/don\u0026rsquo;t like, you can go in and customize this later.
2_Additional Network Features is by far the biggest area of the installer. This contains all the actual network feature addons in the mod. Most networks/network groups will have a \u0026ldquo;Base Features\u0026rdquo; folder, which really ought to be mandatory, as it contains a lot of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s basic additions to each network, along with any Wide Radius/Multi Radius Curves and Fractional Angles, as well as Roundabout options for the various road-type networks.
The main \u0026ldquo;mutually exclusive\u0026rdquo; option to look out for here is with the Maxis Highways (there\u0026rsquo;s two options\u0026ndash;\$1=Default Style, which keeps the Maxis Highways\u0026rsquo; default look and adds the NAM\u0026rsquo;s additions for it, or \$2-Maxis Highway Override (RHW-Style), which completely reskins the Maxis Highways, removes access to the default interchanges, and replaces them with RHW-style modular interchange functionality and a few new ploppable interchanges. Using the RealHighway (RHW) option is pretty much mandatory if you\u0026rsquo;re going this route).
The other ones to watch out for are in Water Transport, where the Canal Addon Mod (CAN-AM) has two mutually-exclusive styles (\$1=Callagrafx Style and \$2-SimGoober Style), and there\u0026rsquo;s also quite a few \u0026ldquo;non-default\u0026rdquo; options in Roads, One-Way Roads, and Avenues.
Those three non-default options are !Legacy Auto Avenue Turn Lanes (these are the old auto-turn lanes that appear on Avenue x Avenue intersections\u0026ndash;largely considered \u0026ldquo;deprecated\u0026rdquo; now, as they can interfere with some newer functionality), !Legacy Semi-Auto Road Turn Lanes (the \u0026ldquo;semi-auto\u0026rdquo; replacement for the old auto-turn lanes on Road x Road intersections, which now appear by clicking over Road x Road + and T-intersections with the One-Way Road tool, also somewhat \u0026ldquo;deprecated\u0026rdquo; now), and !One-Way Road Arrow Plugins. These Arrow Plugins are mostly just a matter of taste, and, despite the folder naming, actually supposed to be mutually exclusive. \u0026ldquo;Elimination\u0026rdquo; gets rid of the arrows entirely, \u0026ldquo;Reduction\u0026rdquo; hides some of them (and actually impacts the base functionality of the OWR network to some degree), while \u0026ldquo;Single Arrows\u0026rdquo; replaces the default double arrows with just a single arrow (which looks nicer on the NWM networks).
The rest of 2_Additional Network Features is pretty self-explanatory, though micromanagement of these options is not recommended, since it is possible to produce a broken installation this way. RealRailway is the only/default option for Rail now, it\u0026rsquo;s best to go all or nothing on RealHighways (RHW) and the Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue folder\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Additional Widths and Turn Lanes\u0026rdquo; option (which contains the Network Widening Mod and FLEX Turn Lanes). And if something says \u0026ldquo;Legacy\u0026rdquo; but it\u0026rsquo;s not prefixed with \u0026ldquo;!\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s probably safest to install it, as it pertains to being able to keep certain older, deprecated content working, if you\u0026rsquo;ve built it with previous versions.
Information for Users on Lower-End Systems (32-Bit Windows/\u0026lt;4GB RAM) # Users attempting to run the NAM as installed by default with the full NAM Controller, on systems with 32-bit Windows and/or less than 4GB RAM, will not be able to make use of the required 4GB Patch, and will encounter Crash-to-Desktop (CTD) errors with that default Controller. The only solution to this is to either select one of the \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; options in the installer, or use the NAM Controller Compiler to manually compile a smaller Controller file. Instructions on using the Controller Compiler may be found here. Note that the \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; options do not include ANY code for the RealHighway (RHW) plugin, so attempting to build RHW systems will result in everything reverting to the base RHW-2 network. The single biggest contributor to the Controller\u0026rsquo;s size is the RealHighway (RHW) plugin, so unchecking (or strictly limiting) the RHW options in the Compiler will have the greatest impact in mitigating that file size. Note that the NAM Controller is one of the most critical files in the entire mod; without a NAM Controller, none of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s menu buttons will function, instead resulting in a \u0026ldquo;red arrow\u0026rdquo; when clicked.
The NAM Team is currently evaluating the possibility of producing a further \u0026ldquo;NAM Lite\u0026rdquo; package, designed to support lower-end systems, novice users, and those seeking a thinner install right out of the gate, with all the other improvements present in the most recent version of the NAM.
Users wishing to run just the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Traffic Simulator improvements should skip the NAM installer itself, and instead run the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT), which is located in the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool folder of the download.
Distribution and Old Versions # The NAM Team only provides support and allows distribution of the most recent NAM version. With the exception of older non-English language versions (which are supported by their respective sites, not the NAM Team), no technical support will be provided to users of prior versions of the NAM, nor will any past versions of the NAM be made available for download, by request or otherwise. The team does not keep an official archive of past releases, and does not have the resources to answer questions regarding them. Each release includes improvements across the board to features new and old, is designed to be as compatible with cities built with previous versions as is humanly possible, and is also intended to improve the end user experience. Old releases are inherently inferior, and not \u0026ldquo;simpler\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;easier\u0026rdquo; to use.
Users wanting a smaller feature set, due to technical limitations, or unfamiliarity with the NAM\u0026rsquo;s vast options, should instead seek to install fewer options in the current NAM, potentially coupled with the \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; option, manually compiling a smaller NAM Controller, or wait for the proposed \u0026ldquo;NAM Lite\u0026rdquo; package to release.
Users wishing to hold onto old versions should back them up in their personal archives. Note again that no technical support will be provided for this, nor may any user or site redistribute any old versions.

`}),e.add({id:1,href:"/docs/reference/installation-notes/",title:"Installation Notes",description:"These are the most common questions that have been asked about the Network Addon Mod.",content:`Before beginning installation, make sure you have the following installed:
Java Runtime Environment (available from AdoptOpenJDK\u0026ndash;a 64-bit Windows copy of JRE 11 is enclosed in the download) Note: in order to ensure proper installation of NAM releases using the current installer, please remove the \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod\u0026rdquo; folder (and if still present, \u0026ldquo;z___NAM\u0026rdquo; folder) from the Plugins directory (usually My Documents\\SimCity 4\\Plugins on Windows) before installing a new NAM version. The Cleanup/Cleanitol functionality is not presently designed to remove full NAM installations.
If you wish to only install the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Traffic Simulator Plugin, we recommend that rather than installing the NAM itself, that you load up the included Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT), which is contained within the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool folder in the download.
Requirements and Compatibility # The Network Addon Mod, in its current form with default installation options, is designed to run on systems with a 64-bit operating system and at least 4GB RAM. Most modern systems should be able to comfortably run the mod. By installing fewer options and using the \u0026ldquo;LowRAM/NoRHW\u0026rdquo; Controller options (or the Controller Compiler to manually compile a custom smaller NAM Controller), however, it is possible to run the NAM on 32-bit operating systems, and/or systems with 4GB or less RAM. At least 1.2GB of hard drive space is required, in order to fully unpack the installer, but actual installation size may run from as little as 1.7MB to as much as 1.2GB, depending on the options chosen and if one selects to manually run the Controller Compiler after installation.
Note, however, that Windows users attempting to run the \u0026ldquo;Full/4GB\u0026rdquo; Controller options without the 4GB Patch, on a 32-bit version of Windows, and/or have less than 4GB RAM, that the game will crash to desktop (CTD) upon attempting to load a city. Following the proper installation procedure will avoid this issue.
The Network Addon Mod is compatible with the following versions of the game:
A) Retail Windows digital copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe OR SimCity 4 with the Rush Hour Expansion Pack (Version 1.1.641), from all digital retailers except Origin (i.e. GOG.com, Steam). B) Retail Windows disc copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe OR SimCity 4 with the Rush Hour Expansion Pack, updated to at least Version 1.1.638 (note that disc copies do not run on Windows 10). C) Digital Windows copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe obtained redeeming an existing CD key (not purchasing) through Origin Customer Support. D) Retail Mac digital copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe, purchased through Steam, or, if running macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or earlier, the App Store version. E) Retail Mac disc copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe, running on macOS/OS X Version 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or earlier. (NOTE: Platform-specific technical support for the NAM on macOS is extremely limited.) The Network Addon Mod is NOT compatible with the following versions of the game:
F) Retail disc copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe OR SimCity 4 with the Rush Hour Expansion Pack that have not been patched (Version 1.1.610 or 1.1.613). G) Retail Windows digital copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe purchased from Origin. H) Copies utilized as part of EA Play (formerly Origin Access)/Xbox Game Pass. I) The App Store version of the Mac port, if running on macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later. J) Retail disc copies of non-Deluxe SimCity 4 (sometimes marketed later as \u0026ldquo;SimCity 4 Classic\u0026rdquo;), without the Rush Hour Expansion Pack (Version 1.0.272 or earlier) K) Pirated or cracked copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe OR SimCity 4 with the Rush Hour Expansion Pack. What should I do if the NAM does not support my copy of the game?
The new NAM installer (introduced with the NAM 37 Release Candidate) no longer runs a version check. However, it is strongly recommended that users check the version they are running, as unpatched copies can be unstable. Version 1.1.610 and Version 1.1.613 are NOT supported. In Case F, the solution is simply to install the EP1 Update 1 patch, which can be downloaded from EA (SKU 1-5), SimCity 4 Devotion (SKU 1-5), or Simtropolis (SKU 1 and 2 only). To determine the correct SKU version for your copy of SimCity 4, find the installation directory, and look in the subfolder named sku_data. Alternatively, one can simply try all the SKU versions of the patch, until one works.
For Case G and H, see the section about Origin below.
For Case I, changes Apple made to the \u0026ldquo;sandboxing\u0026rdquo; system with macOS 11 (Big Sur) have effectively made it impossible to play the App Store version with any kind of mods or plugins. We recommend you seek a refund and instead purchase the Steam version of the macOS port. Users still running the App Store version on macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or earlier should still be able to install the mod, though with more difficulty than the Steam version, due to the reliance on sandboxing. See the section about macOS here.
For Cases J and K, it is recommended that you purchase a digital copy of SimCity 4 Deluxe (NOT from Origin).
What if my disc copy has simply stopped working with Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, or 10?
Microsoft decided in 2015 that secdrv.sys, the driver file used by the SafeDisc and other disc copy protection systems present in many PC games from the early 2000s, was a security threat. As a result, the driver was not included as part of Windows 10, and Microsoft issued a Windows Update, KB3086255, which disables secdrv.sys on Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1. In the case of the older versions of Windows, secdrv.sys can be re-enabled when needed through the use of the command prompt or a batch file.
Aside from the advanced step of manually signing a device driver for Windows 10, the only viable courses of action are to either purchase a retail digital copy of the game (NOT from Origin), or to redeem your CD key at no cost via Origin Customer Support (which, unlike purchasing from Origin, will result in you receiving a properly-patched version of SimCity 4 Deluxe).
Note that cracked executables (i.e. a \u0026ldquo;No CD\u0026rdquo; .exe) are not eligible for tech support. The NAM Team does not support piracy, but understands the frustration with the game\u0026rsquo;s original DRM system being blocked by Microsoft, forcing one to buy a new digital copy in order to continue playing. However, the reason why cracked executables are not eligible is for more practical reasons, namely the potential for version mismatches (i.e. a Version 1.1.638 crack with Version 1.1.610/613 .DAT files, or vice-versa), which can greatly complicate the team\u0026rsquo;s efforts to provide useful technical support to users. The Origin issues played a role in our keeping the version check in place, until the recent installer change in 2020.
Please note that if you are attempting to use an older, 32-bit version of Windows (i.e. Windows XP) in order to still run your disc game, this will substantially hamper the performance of the game with the full NAM installed, and it is highly recommended that you run the game on a 64-bit operating system. If you must run on a 32-bit OS, you will need to either select one of the \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; NAM Controller options, or manually run the Controller Compiler and install a smaller feature set. (The RealHighway (RHW) system is by far the largest part of the NAM.)
Various Important Notes # Note that the NTCore 4GB Patch is REQUIRED if you are running the Full NAM Controller (\u0026ldquo;4GB Full\u0026rdquo; options in the installer), which is required to use the RealHighway (RHW) system. If the installation procedure is begun via NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version44.bat, as is the new recommended procedure, the 4GB Patch should be automatically applied to the game. Otherwise, the patch can be found inside the download, or downloaded directly from NTCore here, where further instructions on use of the patch can be found. Also due to this installer change, the NAM Controller Compiler is no longer run as part of the installation process. Users will have an option to install one of two pre-built NAM Controller options, the Full \u0026ldquo;4GB\u0026rdquo; option, which has a substantial size and requires the 4GB Patch and a 64-bit operating system, or a \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; version that does not require the 4GB Patch, and does not include the code for the RealHighway (RHW) system, the most expansive fetaure in the mod. The \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; version should be used by those with 32-bit operating systems (i.e. Windows XP), less than 4GB RAM, and/or by those not using the RHW. Users wishing for further customization of NAM Controller size can still run the Controller Compiler manually, as it is available in the download.
Users wishing to simply use the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Traffic Simulator improvements should skip the main NAM Installation and instead load up the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT), which is in the folder of the same name. The tool itself is \u0026ldquo;TSCT.jar\u0026rdquo;, though may be easier to open using the batch file (\u0026ldquo;TSCT.bat\u0026rdquo;). Note that the TSCT also requires the Java Runtime Environment.
The NAM uses a Java-based installer, designed by daeley, which is cross-platform (meaning no more separate Mac versions, and Linux support without WINE). As such, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is now REQUIRED to run the NAM installer. It was previous recommended for users wishing to utilize the NAM Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT). A Windows 64-bit copy of OpenJDK 11 is included in the download (OpenJDK11U-jre_x64_windows_hotspot_11.0.8_10.msi). Other open source distributions of Java can be downloaded from here.
Users who fundamentally object to installing Java (or are unable to for other reasons) can perform a manual install, with patience. Details can be found here
With the new installer, the old NAM installation is no longer removed automatically, so users should manually remove the \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;z___NAM\u0026rdquo; folders from their Plugins directory. If you use the \u0026ldquo;Cleanup\u0026rdquo; option under the \u0026ldquo;Setup\u0026rdquo; tab, it is highly recommended that you select the \u0026ldquo;Backup\u0026rdquo; option upon completion, and \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; will in fact delete all those files, making them unrecoverable. It is recommended, particularly with this Release Candidate, that you back those folders up in a location that is not in your Plugins folder. The \u0026ldquo;z___NAM\u0026rdquo; folder has been eliminated, and all files are now installed to the \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod\u0026rdquo; directory.
The RealRailway (RRW) standard for Rail is now the default and only option. One may choose to disable the RRW\u0026rsquo;s more restrictive default slope settings by unselecting the \u0026ldquo;RRW Tunnel and Slope Parameters\u0026rdquo; box in the installer. The original Maxis Rail specification will be supported via a Legacy Plugin, downloaded separately, at a later date. Also note that a number of cosmetic-oriented NAM plugins, such as the El-Rail Alternate Implementation, the Bullet Train Mod, and some advanced texture options (largely deprecated) have been removed from the installer. The Alternate El-Rail and BTM will be made available separately at a later date. Please note that, much like Maxis Rail, these Plugins are effectively in \u0026ldquo;Legacy\u0026rdquo; status, and may not be actively maintained or supported by the NAM Team going forward. Both the original Maxis Highways (MHW) and the \u0026ldquo;Maxis Highway Override/Project Symphony\u0026rdquo; (MHO) remain available.
The Station Locator, Updater, and Reconstruction Project (SLURP) is also no longer handled by the new installer. A scaled down version of the old installer will be made at a later date to handle SLURP routines. Users wishing to retain SLURPed stations should retrieve them from the \u0026ldquo;z___NAM\\Mass Transit Lots\\Station Overrides\u0026rdquo; folder in their existing NAM installation, where they will be found in the \u0026ldquo;Mass Transit Lots\u0026rdquo; subfolder. Note that users running the 64-bit version of SimCity 4 on macOS may wish to refrain from retrieving SLURP stations, as there have been some encoding issues with stations that cause that version of the game to CTD.
The new installer also no longer performs a version check. Please note, however, that for Windows users, Version 1.1.638 and above are still required, as Versions 1.1.610 and 1.1.613 have notable instabilities that may have a significant negative impact on the use of this mod. Copies purchased from the Origin Store may still not meet this requirement, and support will not be offered to users with \u0026ldquo;unofficial\u0026rdquo; copies of the game.
Notice to Users Who Purchased a Digital Copy from Origin, or Use EA Play or Xbox Game Pass # Aside from a brief period in 2014-2015, Origin, the digital retail platform run by Electronic Arts (EA), has been selling defective copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe to retail customers. As of the release of NAM 44, this appears to still be the case. Unlike the retail versions sold by GOG.com, Steam, and Amazon (the \u0026ldquo;Thin Game Download\u0026rdquo; version), which come pre-patched to Version 1.1.641, the Origin retail copy is Version 1.1.610. By virtue of switching out the original SafeDisc copy protection for their own DRM, Origin altered the checksum of the game\u0026rsquo;s executable, which prevents the EP1 Update 1 patcher\u0026ndash;a piece of software they made\u0026ndash;from running. This not only prevents the NAM from being installed, but leaves Origin retail copies with all the bugs that the developers fixed in 2003. It also prevents first-party content creation tools like the Building Architect Tool (BAT) from being installed. In effect, the Origin retail copy is unpatched and unpatchable.
Since the EA Play (formerly Origin Access) service, which is included as part of Xbox Game Pass, utilizes Origin files, users playing SimCity 4 Deluxe through either of these services are also presently saddled with the unpatchable/unpatched Version 1.1.610.
For those who have purchased the game via the Origin Store, the NAM Team recommends you contact Origin Customer Support about obtaining a refund, even after the return period has expired, as users have had success in this case. If you are among the users who are saddled with the unpatched and unpatchable Origin retail version, the team would also appreciate hearing from you, as we have a strong desire to see Origin give their customers a properly-patched copy of the game, and are trying to document just how many users are affected. Those playing via EA Play/Xbox Game Pass should also let EA Play know that they are serving up a defective copy of the game.
Strangely, copies obtained by redeeming an existing CD key at no cost with Origin Customer Support (Case C) are properly patched, despite what the same support team routinely tells those who bought copies and received defective Version 1.1.610 digital copies.
In short:
Free copy from Origin Support for CD Key Redemption: Properly patched (1.1.641) Purchased copy from Origin Store, or playing via EA Play (formerly Origin Access)/Xbox Game Pass: Unpatched and unpatchable (1.1.610) For a more detailed assessment of the Origin situation, NAM developer Tarkus has written extensively on the subject at his blog, SimTarkus.
Note to Mac Users # Aspyr recently issued an update to their port of SimCity 4 Deluxe for macOS, updating it from a 32-bit app to a 64-bit one on both Steam and the App Store, allowing it to be compatible with macOS Catalina (10.15) and later. This change has introduced a number of quirks, however.
As of macOS 11 (Big Sur), changes to the operating system\u0026rsquo;s handling of \u0026ldquo;sandboxing\u0026rdquo; means that the App Store version of the game no longer supports mods.
Most notably, it has changed the key combination for cycling through TAB Loops under the NAM\u0026rsquo;s various buttons. Instead of using TAB to move forward, and Shift-TAB to move in reverse, Mac users must now use Ctrl-TAB to move forward, and Ctrl-Shift-TAB to move in reverse. While TAB and Shift-TAB will allow one to move through the TAB Loop, these keys/combinations will cause some pieces under the buttons to be skipped.
Furthermore, the changes have also broken simmaster07\u0026rsquo;s SC4MacInjector, which allowed DLL plugins\u0026ndash;including SC4Fix.dll (which addressed the puzzle piece/TE Lot CTDs)\u0026ndash;to run on macOS. As such, these fixes no longer work on Mac, and users should exercise caution when placing stations in the vicinity of static puzzle pieces.
Additionally, the installation procedure for the NAM varies depending on if one is using the Steam version or the App Store version.
With the Steam version, the NAM will install into the correct location by default: /Users/{username}/Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins/.
With the App Store version, after running the installer, move \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod\u0026rdquo; folder from the default install location to /Users/{username}/Library/Containers/com.aspyr.simcity4.appstore/Data/Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins/. Note again, however, that this only works on macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or earlier. The App Store version on macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later does not support mods.
Preparing to Install The NAM # When one initially opens the NAM package after downloading, there will be several items present, besides the document you are now reading: NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version44.jar, NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version44.bat, and NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version44.sh, all of which are part of the installation process (depending on your operating system), 4gb_patch.exe is the NTCore 4GB Patch, the Controller Compiler folder contains the NAM Controller Compiler, the Documentation is loose in the folder (and in the \u0026ldquo;feature-guides\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;images\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; folders), and the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool folder, which contains the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT).
Before beginning installation, regardless of operating system, remove your existing NAM installation, which will be located in the \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod\u0026rdquo; folder (and if installed pre-2020, may also include a \u0026ldquo;z___NAM\u0026rdquo; folder) inside your main Plugins directory. The Cleanup/Cleanitol tab in the installer is not presently set up to remove a full NAM installation, and cannot be relied upon to do so for you.
To begin installation, follow the directions for your operating system:
On Windows, open NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version44.bat. On Mac, open NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version44.jar. On Linux, open NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version44.sh. Simply dumping the files into your Plugins folder WILL NOT install the NAM\u0026ndash;you will get no new menu buttons, and will just slow down the game. The installer MUST be run, or the manual installation procedure must be followed. If you are on Windows, it is recommended that you If User Access Control (UAC) is enabled on your system, Windows may ask you to approve running the file with a simple \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo; prompt. Click \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; to allow the installer to run.
In order to progress through the installer, simply click on each tab. Note that the license agreement must be agreed to before subsequent tabs can be accessed. The \u0026ldquo;Cleanup\u0026rdquo; tab allows one to remove some residual files from old NAM releases, and pre-NAM transit mods that might cause conflicts, and is loaded with the old Cleanitol list that shipped with NAM 36. It is highly recommended that you choose the \u0026ldquo;Backup\u0026rdquo; option instead of \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; after doing so, as \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; will completely wipe out the files, as the label implies. Note that it presently is not capable of removing an entire NAM installation, which should be done manually prior to installing a new release.
For more details on the installation process and options, see the installation section of the NAM documentation.
Upgrading from a Previous Version # If you are upgrading from a previous version of the NAM, MANUALLY MOVE YOUR OLD NAM INSTALLATION OUT FROM YOUR PLUGINS FOLDER, INTO A SAFE LOCATION (note that this has changed from previous NAM releases).. The NAM installer can no longer detect your previous installation options by reading the existing folder structure. It is recommended that you check your existing installation, to determine which features you presently have installed.
Generally speaking, the NAM Team makes every effort to ensure that new versions at least retain some form of \u0026ldquo;legacy support\u0026rdquo;, such that cities built with any previous NAM version will continue to function well with the latest version.
If you have consolidated your NAM files using a tool such as SC4DatPacker or JDatPacker, please read here.
Running The Installer # Installer Options # The NAM Installer allows for many different types of installation\u0026ndash;with the current NAM installation, custom installation is the only option, though the most common installation is set to be the default. Note that right-side driving (AKA RHD) and US textures are the default. A base Euro texture option remains available, and both the US and EU options are available for left-side driving (AKA LHD) as well.
There are two different types of NAM Controllers\u0026ndash;the \u0026ldquo;4GB_Full\u0026rdquo; versions (RHD or LHD), which are designed for users with 64-bit operating systems who are either running 64-bit copies of the game (only the Mac port is 64-bit), or have successfully applied the 4GB Patch to the Windows version of the game, and have 4GB or more RAM. The 4GB_Full Controller is REQUIRED to use the RealHighway (RHW) system. Users with lower-spec systems (less than 4GB RAM), on 32-bit operating systems (i.e. Windows XP), and/or desiring a smaller installation without the RealHighway (RHW) system should instead select the \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; option. Installing the 4GB_Full option on a Windows copy of the game with a lower-spec system and/or without the 4GB Patch will cause the game to crash-to-desktop (CTD) upon attempting to load a city tile.
To explore the various options in the NAM, click the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; icons to expand the menus.
Below is a listing of all the NAM\u0026rsquo;s install options
1 Core - This contains Core files for the NAM, required for the mod to function.
Locale Files - This contains the in-game text displays for the mod\u0026rsquo;s features (required). z_NAM Controller_RHD_4GB_Full - This installs the RHD version of the 4GB_Full Controller. Required to use the RealHighway (RHW) options, requires the 4GB Patch in order to run without CTDs upon loading a city. z_NAM Controller_LHD_4GB_Full - This installs the LHD version of the 4GB_Full Controller. Required to use the RealHighway (RHW) options, requires the 4GB Patch in order to run without CTDs upon loading a city. z_NAM Controller_RHD_LowRAM_NoRHW - This installs the RHD version of the LowRAM_NoRHW Controller. This version of the Controller is safe to use on lower-end systems, does not require the 4GB Patch, and does not support the RealHighway (RHW) features. z_NAM Controller_LHD_LowRAM_NoRHW - This installs the LHD version of the LowRAM_NoRHW Controller. This version of the Controller is safe to use on lower-end systems, does not require the 4GB Patch, and does not support the RealHighway (RHW) features. 2 Additional Network Features - This contains all of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s new network additions, the real meat of the mod.
Hybrid Railway (RRW-RHSR) - This option installs Hybrid Railway (HRW), a FLEX Piece-based Rail system designed to allow both standard Freight/Passenger Trains as well as higher speed trains (including future support for the Real High Speed Rail (RHSR) specification). Light Rail - Additions for Light Rail, including the game\u0026rsquo;s base Elevated (Light) Rail network, and the NAM\u0026rsquo;s various Ground Light Rail (GLR)/Tram options. Maxis Highway - Additions for the (Elevated) Highway and Ground Highway networks. Two specifications are offered: the default gray Maxis Highways, and Maxis Highway Override (MHO), a complete revamp of the system with modular interchange functionality, designed to work with (and requiring) the RealHighway (RHW). Monorail - Additions for the Monorail network, including the existing High Speed Rail Project (HSRP). Pedestrian Malls and Paths - This option installs the Pedestrian Malls (PedMalls) and Overpasses, which are Pedestrian-only network features (currently puzzle piece-only). RealHighway - REQUIRES 4GB_Full NAM Controller and the 4GB Patch. This is the NAM\u0026rsquo;s expansive modular highway system, featuring variable width highways at five different elevations, plus double-decker highways, along with the ability to customize where your ramps go. (If you\u0026rsquo;ve seen Haljackey\u0026rsquo;s interchange/highway work, this is what he uses.) The individual options under here should not be unchecked unless you intend to compile a custom NAM Controller excluding certain networks. Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue - This section includes all the various additions to the Road, One-Way Road (OWR), and Avenue networks. By default, this includes Roundabouts, Wide-Radius Curves (WRCs)/Multi-Radius Curves(MRCs), and Fractional Angle (FA) Networking. Options exist for the Elevated Viaducts (Draggable and Legacy Puzzle Piece), the Network Widening Mod (NWM) and Turn Lanes (the new FLEX Turn Lane (FTL) standard and Signalized Intersection and Turn Arrow Project (SITAP) for the OWRs, along with the legacy Turn Lane Extension Pieces (TuLEPs) puzzle-based options, and the old auto Avenue Turn Lanes plugin for Avenue x Avenue +-intersections). The Rural Roads Plugin (RuRP) puzzle pieces are also available as an option here. RRW Tunnel and Slope Parameters - This option installs the RealRailway (RRW) Tunnel and Slope Parameters, designed to give the Rail network more realistic (and restrictive) slopes. Unselecting this will cause the Rail slope functionality to work as it did in the base \u0026ldquo;vanilla\u0026rdquo; game, or according to any third-party slope mod you may have installed. Street - This section includes all the various additions to the Street network. The base feature set adds Roundabouts and Wide Radius Curves (WRCs). The Street Addon Mod (SAM) is also under this section, which adds several cosmetic Street-based override networks, including dirt, gravel, and brick streets of various kinds, among others. Subway and FLUPs - This section includes the NAM\u0026rsquo;s underground functionality, including the Flexible Underpass (FLUPs) system, which now includes Subway-based draggable override networks. Water Transport - This section includes the NAM\u0026rsquo;s water-based transport options, including the Canal Addon Mod (CAN-AM). Note that the CAN-AM system works best with either the SimGoober (SG) or Callagrafx (CAL) canal sets installed (available from the LEX at SC4 Devotion). Rail (RealRailway) - This section includes the NAM\u0026rsquo;s functionality for the Rail network. Since the full NAM requires the RealRailway (RRW) specification\u0026ndash;the only specification currently maintained by the NAM Team\u0026ndash; this whole section is installed by default. Users wishing to revert to Maxis Rail should pick up the Legacy Maxis Rail (LMR) Plugin (once it becomes available). 3 Additional Transit Stations - This section allows for the installation of additional stations for both the game\u0026rsquo;s default networks, as well as some of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s override networks and puzzle piece options. Note that the NAM\u0026rsquo;s override networks/puzzle setups include a basic set of stations out of the box, to allow them to be used. These stations here are simply a supplement to those, and are modded to NAM standards.
4 Automata Controller - This section allows one to select the version of the Automata Controller they would like to use. The Automata Controller affects the display of the game\u0026rsquo;s automata\u0026ndash;cars, trains, etc. that appear on the roads and rails. The \u0026ldquo;Radical\u0026rdquo; options allow for the display of more automata, the \u0026ldquo;24-Hour\u0026rdquo; options synchronize the display with the game\u0026rsquo;s commute clocks, and the \u0026ldquo;Persistent\u0026rdquo; options display the automata longer before they fade out. (Note that the fade out is a necessary part of the game\u0026rsquo;s Automata behavior\u0026ndash;too many Automata being displayed will dramatically slow the game. The Automata are simply visual effect produced either by a statistical correlation from the game\u0026rsquo;s Traffic Simulation, or are spawned by Lots. They are not necessarily indicative of the actual traffic simulation.)
5 Data View Options - This section allows one to select (or unselect) changes to the game\u0026rsquo;s Data Views as they relate to transportation networks, including the Transit Stations on the Traffic Congestion/Volume Data Views, and transit-related refinements to the Zone Data View.
6 Miscellaneous - This section covers a few odds and ends included in the NAM, including options for more detailed Transit Station Queries (the info boxes that appear when you click a Transit Station), Hole Diggers and Ground Raisers (which allow finer, localized control of terrain raising/lowering, at a single-tile level), and capacity fixes for Maxis Transit Lots, designed to synchronize with the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Traffic Simulator improvements.
7 Texture and Drive Side Support - This section allows one to select between US/North American and EU/Euro/International texture sets, for both RHD (vehicles drive on the right) and LHD (vehicles drive on the left). Options also exist for having Cul-De-Sacs at the ends of Streets and Roads, arrows appearing in the center of the Network Widening Mod (NWM)\u0026rsquo;s Turning Lane Avenue (TLA) override networks, and the option to choose between default \u0026ldquo;Maxis Nite\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Dark Nite\u0026rdquo; nightlighting on the new Subway-based FLUPs Portals designed by Girafe.
8 Traffic Simulator - This section allows one to select the capacity level they would like to use for the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Traffic Simulator, in order of lowest capacity (Classic) up to highest (Ultra). Details on the capacities for each network on each setting can be seen in the infobox on the right side of the installer when hovering over each option. Users wishing for further customization of the Traffic Simulator, or who would like to install just the Traffic Simulator without the NAM\u0026rsquo;s other feature additions should look to use the included Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT).
A Note About Drive Side (RHD vs. LHD) # While the NAM Installer, as noted above, has a series of checkboxes in Custom Installation relating to drive side, it is worth re-iterating that these boxes only change the compatibility files installed with the NAM, and do NOT change drive side. If you have an installation with Right-Hand Driving (RHD, vehicles driving on the right side of roads\u0026ndash;this concept is NOT the same as the side one sits on when driving a vehicle) and wish to switch to Left-Hand Driving (LHD, vehicles driving on the left side of roads), this generally needs to be done either by adjusting the game\u0026rsquo;s locale files, and then either editing the game\u0026rsquo;s Windows registry entries, or by modifying the game\u0026rsquo;s shortcut.
The new NAM Installer cannot determine default drive side of your installation, so make note of which side vehicles drive on in your game prior to installation. If you have changed your drive side by modifying the game\u0026rsquo;s shortcut, instead of editing the Windows registry, then this would be the one and only case when changing the box checked here would be needed.
A Note About the \u0026ldquo;4GB Patch\u0026rdquo; # Due to changes in computer systems, and continued expansions of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s main Controller file, in 2013, it was determined that many newer systems, particularly those with more than 4GB of RAM, and running 64-bit versions of Windows, need additional accommodation. To that end, the NAM includes a \u0026ldquo;4GB Patch\u0026rdquo;, also known as a \u0026ldquo;Large Address Aware (LAA) Patch\u0026rdquo;, which allows the game to access the full 4GB of RAM that a 32-bit application can read, instead of the default 2GB. The NAM\u0026rsquo;s patch was designed by NTCore, and built into the NAM with permission, and users with systems that need the patch will receive a prompt during NAM installation to install it. The original patch can be found here.
The only thing this patch does is to switch the Large Address Aware switch, an accessible switch present in all Windows executables, from \u0026ldquo;off\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; for the game\u0026rsquo;s executable. Patches like this are common in game modding communities, including those associated with Skyrim, Fallout, and Morrowind, and can be used to enhance any 32-bit application\u0026rsquo;s performance on systems with 64-bit operating systems and a suitable amount of RAM.
The new installation starting point for Windows users\u0026ndash; NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version44.bat\u0026ndash;should ensure that your game is automatically patched as needed.
Note that the 4GB Patch is NOT required for users on macOS, as that version of the game is 64-bit and can access more RAM than the Windows version (even with the 4GB Patch!) by default.
The default directory for where SimCity 4.exe may be located depends on how and where you purchased your copy of the game.
GOG.com: C:\\GOG Games\\SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition\\Apps Steam: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\SimCity 4 Deluxe\\Apps Original Disc: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Maxis\\SimCity 4 Deluxe\\Apps Origin*: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Maxis\\SimCity 4 Deluxe\\Apps Note that only Origin copies acquired through Free CD Key Redemption (Version 1.1.641) are compatible with the NAM. Copies purchased through the Origin Store or accessed via Origin Access (Version 1.1.610) ARE NOT COMPATIBLE. See here for more details.
Running the Controller Compiler # If you are an advanced user, and would like to trim down your installation of the NAM, it is still possible to run the NAM Controller Compiler (a cross-platform application) after installing the NAM. Extract/open the \u0026ldquo;Controller Compiler\u0026rdquo; folder, and double-click the file \u0026ldquo;NAMControllerCompiler.jar\u0026rdquo;. Select the \u0026lsquo;input\u0026rsquo; folder \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod/Controller/\u0026rdquo; from the current \u0026ldquo;Controller Compiler\u0026rdquo; directory, and the \u0026lsquo;output\u0026rsquo; folder \u0026quot;~/Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins/Network Addon Mod/\u0026quot; inside your plugins. For the rest, follow the instructions of the compiler.
Regarding \u0026ldquo;DatPacking\u0026rdquo; and File Consolidation Post-Installation # Programs to consolidate folders worth of SimCity 4 .DAT files, such as SC4DatPacker (Windows) and JDatPacker (cross-platform), are popular options known to improve game performance, given SimCity 4\u0026rsquo;s preference to read a smaller number of larger files, instead of a larger number of small files\u0026ndash;a fact determined by the BSC Team\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Miramba Experiment\u0026rdquo; of 2006. The use of \u0026ldquo;DatPacking\u0026rdquo; programs on one\u0026rsquo;s NAM installation, however, is a controversial topic. The NAM Team\u0026rsquo;s general advice is for Windows users to avoid DatPacking (unless one is extremely careful, while for Mac users, the use of JDatPacker is virtually required.
In general, if one plans to DatPack one\u0026rsquo;s NAM installation, they should also save the pre-DatPacked NAM folder in a safe place, outside the Plugins folder beforehand. The reason for this is to avoid potential conflicts and issues, such as the \u0026ldquo;dual icon bug\u0026rdquo; and Controller file conflicts between new and old installations, as well as to make it such that one knows which options they have installed when upgrading to a new version, or re-installing the same version with different options.
In the case of the Aspyr port for the Mac platform (both App Store and Steam versions), it possesses a strange quirk in which exceeding a certain number of files or folders (regardless of size) in the Plugins folder can cause game slowdowns or even crashing-to-desktop (CTD). To this end, using JDatPacker after installing the NAM on a Mac is a necessity, in order to ensure proper game performance. Again, however, one should save their pre-DatPacked NAM installation in a safe place, outside the Plugins folder, to make for easy upgrades.
Uninstalling the NAM # To uninstall the files, simply bulldoze every NAM item from this download in your cities and remove the files from the Plugins folder afterwards, which will be contained in Plugins\\Network Addon Mod by default.
Changing Options After Initial Installation # The NAM is a very expansive mod, with a substantial number of features, which may initially prove overwhelming to those not well-versed in its workings. The NAM Team anticipates that users, particularly those new to the NAM, may want to change the feature set they have installed, as they learn more about the mod\u0026rsquo;s contents and capabilities.
To that end, we encourage users to keep the installer for the current version handy after initial installation. If you plan to change your particular set of options, you will need to remove your current installation. Moving it out of Plugins to a safe location is recommended, in case you want to keep your existing settings as a backup.
Manual Installation - Advanced # Users who are unable or unwilling to install Java can perform a manual installation of the NAM, something which the new file architecture introduced in 2020 makes far more possible than the previous \u0026ldquo;Monolithic\u0026rdquo; releases.
This method requires a file decompression tool capable of opening .jar files, such as 7-zip (Windows) or Keka (macOS). To begin, open NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version44.jar using your file decompression tool.
The NAM\u0026rsquo;s contents are located in the \u0026ldquo;installation\u0026rdquo; subfolder. The current installer uses a series of character flags at the start of directory names, in order to instruct the installer how to order the options, whether they\u0026rsquo;re mandatory or optional, etc.
Numbers preceded by the dollar sign (\u0026quot;\$\u0026quot;), i.e. \u0026ldquo;\$1\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;\$2\u0026rdquo;, etc., are merely being ordered with this flag.
Any directory with the caret (\u0026quot;^\u0026quot;) in front of the name (or behind a \u0026ldquo;\$\u0026rdquo; ordering flag) is mandatory.
Any directory with the exclamation mark (\u0026quot;!\u0026quot;) in front of the name (or behind a \u0026ldquo;\$\u0026rdquo; ordering flag) is not installed by default.
Any options where the equal sign (\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;) and the dash (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;) are present are mutually exclusive\u0026ndash;only one should be installed (the \u0026ldquo;=\u0026rdquo; option is the default).
The \u0026ldquo;\$1^Core\u0026rdquo; directory is required. All other folders have options within them. With \u0026ldquo;4_Automata Controller#\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;7_Texture and Drive Side Support\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;8_Traffic Simulator#\u0026rdquo;, simply select one of the options inside and discard the rest, as these are straight up mutually exclusive one another.
The Automata Controller basically affects the display of the visual traffic in-game\u0026ndash;Standard is going to be the lightest, while Radical is going to be the heaviest, Persistent makes the automata visuals last longer, and the 24-Hour modifiers handle whether the display is constant, or follows the data for the 24-Hour clock in-game.
The Texture and Drive Side Support includes four options, depending on whether you want to use US/North American textures or Euro/International Textures, and the drive side of your game (RHD or LHD, which should match your selection for the NAM Controller).
With the Traffic Simulator, these are ordered by the \u0026ldquo;\$1\u0026rdquo; and the like in order of lowest capacity option to highest. Medium is the default.
With 5_DataView Options#, there\u0026rsquo;s two subfolders. Both are just straight up options, with nothing mutually exclusive. You can probably just leave this one as is, unless you really don\u0026rsquo;t like the Data View changes.
With 6_Miscellaneous, the two mutually exclusive options to watch out for are Extended Station Queries (there\u0026rsquo;s four options in there\u0026ndash;very subtle differences between them), and Maxis Transit Lots\\Airport Capacity Adjustment#, which has three options (Default, Medium, and Large). And the Hole Diggers and Raisers are very much recommended\u0026ndash;they have lots of use outside regular NAM usage, too.
With 3_Additional Transit Stations, this depends on if you want more transit stations beyond the game\u0026rsquo;s default, and what the NAM adds by default for certain additional override networks. There should be no harm in either adding this one in whole, or leaving it out altogether, and if there\u0026rsquo;s certain added stations you like/don\u0026rsquo;t like, you can go in and customize this later.
2_Additional Network Features is by far the biggest area of the installer. This contains all the actual network feature addons in the mod. Most networks/network groups will have a \u0026ldquo;Base Features\u0026rdquo; folder, which really ought to be mandatory, as it contains a lot of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s basic additions to each network, along with any Wide Radius/Multi Radius Curves and Fractional Angles, as well as Roundabout options for the various road-type networks.
The main \u0026ldquo;mutually exclusive\u0026rdquo; option to look out for here is with the Maxis Highways (there\u0026rsquo;s two options\u0026ndash;\$1=Default Style, which keeps the Maxis Highways\u0026rsquo; default look and adds the NAM\u0026rsquo;s additions for it, or \$2-Maxis Highway Override (RHW-Style), which completely reskins the Maxis Highways, removes access to the default interchanges, and replaces them with RHW-style modular interchange functionality and a few new ploppable interchanges. Using the RealHighway (RHW) option is pretty much mandatory if you\u0026rsquo;re going this route).
The other ones to watch out for are in Water Transport, where the Canal Addon Mod (CAN-AM) has two mutually-exclusive styles (\$1=Callagrafx Style and \$2-SimGoober Style), and there\u0026rsquo;s also quite a few \u0026ldquo;non-default\u0026rdquo; options in Roads, One-Way Roads, and Avenues.
Those three non-default options are !Legacy Auto Avenue Turn Lanes (these are the old auto-turn lanes that appear on Avenue x Avenue intersections\u0026ndash;largely considered \u0026ldquo;deprecated\u0026rdquo; now, as they can interfere with some newer functionality), !Legacy Semi-Auto Road Turn Lanes (the \u0026ldquo;semi-auto\u0026rdquo; replacement for the old auto-turn lanes on Road x Road intersections, which now appear by clicking over Road x Road + and T-intersections with the One-Way Road tool, also somewhat \u0026ldquo;deprecated\u0026rdquo; now), and !One-Way Road Arrow Plugins. These Arrow Plugins are mostly just a matter of taste, and, despite the folder naming, actually supposed to be mutually exclusive. \u0026ldquo;Elimination\u0026rdquo; gets rid of the arrows entirely, \u0026ldquo;Reduction\u0026rdquo; hides some of them (and actually impacts the base functionality of the OWR network to some degree), while \u0026ldquo;Single Arrows\u0026rdquo; replaces the default double arrows with just a single arrow (which looks nicer on the NWM networks).
The rest of 2_Additional Network Features is pretty self-explanatory, though micromanagement of these options is not recommended, since it is possible to produce a broken installation this way. RealRailway is the only/default option for Rail now, it\u0026rsquo;s best to go all or nothing on RealHighways (RHW) and the Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue folder\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Additional Widths and Turn Lanes\u0026rdquo; option (which contains the Network Widening Mod and FLEX Turn Lanes). And if something says \u0026ldquo;Legacy\u0026rdquo; but it\u0026rsquo;s not prefixed with \u0026ldquo;!\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s probably safest to install it, as it pertains to being able to keep certain older, deprecated content working, if you\u0026rsquo;ve built it with previous versions.
Information for Users on Lower-End Systems (32-Bit Windows/\u0026lt;4GB RAM) # Users attempting to run the NAM as installed by default with the full NAM Controller, on systems with 32-bit Windows and/or less than 4GB RAM, will not be able to make use of the required 4GB Patch, and will encounter Crash-to-Desktop (CTD) errors with that default Controller. The only solution to this is to either select one of the \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; options in the installer, or use the NAM Controller Compiler to manually compile a smaller Controller file. Instructions on using the Controller Compiler may be found here. Note that the \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; options do not include ANY code for the RealHighway (RHW) plugin, so attempting to build RHW systems will result in everything reverting to the base RHW-2 network. The single biggest contributor to the Controller\u0026rsquo;s size is the RealHighway (RHW) plugin, so unchecking (or strictly limiting) the RHW options in the Compiler will have the greatest impact in mitigating that file size. Note that the NAM Controller is one of the most critical files in the entire mod; without a NAM Controller, none of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s menu buttons will function, instead resulting in a \u0026ldquo;red arrow\u0026rdquo; when clicked.
The NAM Team is currently evaluating the possibility of producing a further \u0026ldquo;NAM Lite\u0026rdquo; package, designed to support lower-end systems, novice users, and those seeking a thinner install right out of the gate, with all the other improvements present in the most recent version of the NAM.
Users wishing to run just the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Traffic Simulator improvements should skip the NAM installer itself, and instead run the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT), which is located in the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool folder of the download.
Distribution and Old Versions # The NAM Team only provides support and allows distribution of the most recent NAM version. With the exception of older non-English language versions (which are supported by their respective sites, not the NAM Team), no technical support will be provided to users of prior versions of the NAM, nor will any past versions of the NAM be made available for download, by request or otherwise. The team does not keep an official archive of past releases, and does not have the resources to answer questions regarding them. Each release includes improvements across the board to features new and old, is designed to be as compatible with cities built with previous versions as is humanly possible, and is also intended to improve the end user experience. Old releases are inherently inferior, and not \u0026ldquo;simpler\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;easier\u0026rdquo; to use.
Users wanting a smaller feature set, due to technical limitations, or unfamiliarity with the NAM\u0026rsquo;s vast options, should instead seek to install fewer options in the current NAM, potentially coupled with the \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; option, manually compiling a smaller NAM Controller, or wait for the proposed \u0026ldquo;NAM Lite\u0026rdquo; package to release.
Users wishing to hold onto old versions should back them up in their personal archives. Note again that no technical support will be provided for this, nor may any user or site redistribute any old versions.
`}),e.add({id:2,href:"/docs/reference/in-game-basics-with-the-nam/",title:"In-Game Basics with the NAM",description:"The NAM has an incredibly exhaustive array of features -- understanding these concepts will make it much easier to use various tools in the NAM.",content:`Basic Types of Content # With respect to all the transportation network expansions within the NAM, they fall into two categories: Draggable Items, produced through dragging a transportation network in some fashion, and Ploppable Items, which are placed in a single click. Within these two categories, there are distinctions.
Subtypes of Draggable Items # Simple Draggable Items, which are constructed simply by dragging the network (or combination of networks) in an immediately apparent and intuitive manner. Pattern-Based Draggable Items, which are constructed by dragging out a special pattern with a given network (or combination of networks). Subtypes of Ploppable Items # Static Puzzle Pieces (often simply called \u0026ldquo;Puzzle Pieces\u0026rdquo;), which are transportation network pieces, which do not interact with surrounding stretches of network, and remain fixed in form after placement. Starter Pieces, which are very simple transportation network pieces, which are designed specifically to interact with the game\u0026rsquo;s base transportation networks and override them on a case-by-case basis, changing their appearance and behavior. In the absence of the ability to add additional \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; transportation networks, Starter Pieces have allowed the NAM to emulate those additions. The products of Starter Piece transformations are referred to as Override Networks. FLEX Pieces, which are transportation network pieces that do interact with the surrounding stretches of network, and can accept overrides from various types of Draggable Items, Starter Pieces, and other FLEX Pieces, allowing a single piece to serve multiple functions, unlike a Static Puzzle Piece. FLEX Pieces, in some instances, can also act as more complex Starter Pieces, designed to serve specific purposes. Disconnectors, which are more delicate versions of the game\u0026rsquo;s default Bulldozer tool, primarily intended for use with the RealHighway plugin. Hole Digger/Raiser Effects, which raise or lower the terrain by specific amounts upon placement. (These are not to be confused with the older Hole Digger/Raiser Lots.) Transit-Enabled Lots (or \u0026ldquo;TE Lots\u0026rdquo;), which are technically not transportation network items, but Lots that can accept input from transportation networks, carry traffic, and serve additional transportation-related purposes. Generally, they are used for transit stations, as they allow sims to switch transit types (i.e. from riding a train to walking). Toll booths are also a common use of TE Lots. Navigating NAM Menus and Items # While Simple and Pattern-Based Draggable Items are constructed directly through dragging the game\u0026rsquo;s base transportation networks, all ploppable items must be selected via the game\u0026rsquo;s menu system. The positioning of a given object can be controlled by using the following keys:
Home - rotate clockwise End - rotate counter-clockwise Note that with some items, Home/End rotation may produce a variant on the piece (i.e. a diagonal equivalent), or in some cases\u0026ndash;particularly with the Flexible Underpasses (FLUPs)\u0026ndash;may be the means to access entirely different pieces. These situations will be noted in the catalogue listings in the Feature Guides included in this documentation.
All Ploppable Items except Transit-Enabled Lots\u0026ndash;can all be combined into a set that is accessed under a single menu button, through the use of a TAB Loop (known internally as a \u0026ldquo;RotationRing\u0026rdquo;). TAB Loops are named because the use of the TAB key, and key combinations involving it, allow one to cycle through the various items under the selected button. Navigation through the various options under a single button is controlled using the following keys:
TAB - forward through the loop Shift-TAB - backward through the loop For instance, if a TAB Loop contains a total of 10 Ploppable Items, it would begin with Item 1, TAB would move forward to Item 2, Item 3, and so on, while Shift-TAB would move in reverse to Item 10, Item 9, etc. Once the end of the loop is reached, it will cycle back around to Item 1 and continue from there.
Each Transit-Enabled Lot must have its own menu button, as Lot-based items cannot be placed in TAB Loops. For more information, see the Technical Information documentation.
Special Note to Steam Users: The Steam Overlay is set to use the key combination Shift-TAB by default. Through the Steam client, you will need to either change the key combination for the overlay, or disable it altogether in order to allow backward rotation through TAB Loops. The use of TAB and Shift-TAB by SimCity 4 is hardcoded, and attempting to use Shift-TAB without changing the overlay shortcut will cause the overlay to appear, instead of allowing one to navigate a TAB Loop in reverse as intended.
Using Static Puzzle Pieces # Static Puzzle Pieces, once selected, will produce a hovering preview, showing the footprint of the piece over the terrain. Simply align the footprint with the desired position, using the Home and End keys to rotate and the mouse to align, and click the left mouse button to place the piece. If the preview appears to be highlighted in red, this means that the terrain or existing transportation network/lot setup underneath will not permit the piece to be placed. Static Puzzle Pieces can generally be placed over growable RCI (Residential/Commercial/Industrial) buildings, and will destroy any that lie in the footprint.
If you are planning on using sections of draggable network in the vicinity of the Static Puzzle Piece, unless the piece happens to have connector stubs, it is generally advisable to build the draggable network first, at least up to the edge of the Static Puzzle Piece\u0026rsquo;s footprint, and then place the piece itself over top.
Some Static Puzzle Pieces\u0026ndash;particularly those in the RealHighway (RHW) plugin\u0026ndash;may have Starter Piece stubs attached to them, which, while easing the process of connecting the piece to the surrounding network, does limit the placement options for the piece to mostly flat terrain.
Static Puzzle Pieces do not accept overrides, and in addition to not changing to match their surroundings, will block the continuation of Override Networks. The only way to change the setup is to bulldoze the Static Puzzle Piece, and replace it with something else.
Using Starter Pieces and Override Networks # Starter Pieces, once selected, will produce a hovering preview, showing the footprint of the piece over the terrain. Simply align the footprint with the desired position, using the Home and End keys to rotate and the mouse to align, and click the left mouse button to place the piece. If the preview appears to be highlighted in red, this means that the terrain or existing transportation network/lot setup underneath will not permit the piece to be placed.
All Starter Pieces have a \u0026ldquo;Construction Tile\u0026rdquo;, which is required by the game. The Construction Tile will be placed at the site of the cursor, and will self-destruct upon placement. If there is an existing stretch of network underneath the Construction Tile, a 1x1 \u0026ldquo;gap\u0026rdquo; will appear in its place after placement. Starter Pieces can generally be placed over growable RCI (Residential/Commercial/Industrial) buildings, and will destroy any that lie in the footprint\u0026ndash;this is true of both the starter itself, and the Construction Tile.
Each Starter Piece will have a \u0026ldquo;base network\u0026rdquo; associated with it, which will be indicated on the tool-tip for the Starter Piece, shown while the piece is selected. In order to activate the override permitted by the Starter Piece, select the indicated network, and then drag the base network through the Starter Piece. It should cause the base draggable network to convert to match the appearance of the Starter Piece, producing an Override Network.
Using FLEX Pieces # FLEX Pieces, once selected, will produce a hovering preview, showing the footprint of the piece over the terrain. Simply align the footprint with the desired position, using the Home and End keys to rotate and the mouse to align, and click the left mouse button to place the piece. If the preview appears to be highlighted in red, this means that the terrain or existing transportation network/lot setup underneath will not permit the piece to be placed.
All FLEX Pieces have a \u0026ldquo;Construction Tile\u0026rdquo;, which is required by the game. The Construction Tile will be placed at the site of the cursor, and will self-destruct upon placement. If there is an existing stretch of network underneath the Construction Tile, a 1x1 \u0026ldquo;gap\u0026rdquo; will appear in its place after placement. FLEX Pieces can generally be placed over growable RCI (Residential/Commercial/Industrial) buildings, and will destroy any that lie in the footprint\u0026ndash;this is true of both the starter itself, and the Construction Tile.
Many FLEX Pieces will accept input from Override Networks, changing their appearance and function accordingly. To transform a FLEX Piece to a new configuration, simply drag the Override Network into the appropriate part of the FLEX Piece. If the setup is supported, it should transform to fit.
Some pieces of this type can also serve as Starter Pieces. For specific instances, see the Feature Guides.
Using Pattern-Based Draggable Items # Pattern-Based Draggable Items are items built using a specific dragging pattern with one of the game\u0026rsquo;s base networks. Upon completing the appropriate pattern, the item will convert over to the desired setup. Pattern-Based Draggable Items exist throughout the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Plugins, with prominent examples in the Roundabout plugins, Wide-Radius Curves and Fractional Angle Networking, the transitions in the Network Widening Mod (NWM) plugin, and on/offramps in the RealHighway plugin.
Many Pattern-Based Draggable Items will accept input from the default networks and/or Override Networks, changing their appearance and function accordingly. To transform a Pattern-Based Draggable Item to a new configuration, simply drag the desired network into the appropriate part of the pattern. If the setup is supported, it should transform to fit.

`}),e.add({id:4,href:"/docs/reference/frequently-asked-questions/",title:"Frequently Asked Questions",description:"These are the most common questions that have been asked about the Network Addon Mod.",content:` What is the Network Addon Mod?
The Network Addon Mod, or NAM, is a transportation mod for SimCity 4 Deluxe/Rush Hour. It includes options for improved pathfinding accuracy and performance with the game\u0026rsquo;s traffic simulator, as well as a myriad of new transportation network options, and bugfixes for default content. It is basically an exhaustive community-made expansion pack.
What is required to run the NAM?
You must be running a retail copy of SimCity 4 Deluxe/Rush Hour, with a version number of 1.1.638 or higher. For further information, see the compatibility info on the opening page of the documentation. Any computer built since SC4\u0026rsquo;s release in 2003 should have sufficient power to run the NAM, though the use of a 64-bit operating system and at least 4GB RAM is highly recommended. The NAM is not compatible with original SimCity 4 (non-Deluxe/without Rush Hour), nor is it intended to run on Deluxe/Rush Hour copies with version numbers of 1.1.610 or 1.1.613.
Why is my game crashing to desktop when I load a city tile after installing this mod?
The crash to desktop (CTD) issues upon city load are the product of having a full NAM Controller installed, but without the NTCore 4GB Patch being properly installed. The .bat file recommended for Windows users to use to begin NAM installation should patch your game automatically, but Windows permissions issues can complicate this (running the .bat file as an administrator can help), and the presence of these sorts of CTDs are an indication that the process did not properly complete.
The 4GB Patch is a small patch, usable on any 32-bit executable file (not just SimCity 4) that allows the application to access 4GB RAM instead of a mere 2GB, and has historically been used in many modding communities associated with older games. This can also happen if your system is running a 32-bit version of Windows (i.e. if you\u0026rsquo;re still running Windows XP), and/or you have less than 4GB RAM. Both of these situations effectively render the improvements of the 4GB Patch (and the compatibility it provides with the Full version of the NAM Controller) moot. Note that the \u0026ldquo;LowRam/NoRHW\u0026rdquo; Controller options do not require the 4GB Patch, but they completely omit almost all the code required for the NAM\u0026rsquo;s RealHighway (RHW) Plugin to function.
Does this mod work on a Mac?
Yes. The NAM is a cross-platform mod, with a cross-platform Java installer, and being cross-platform, it will run on macOS, even more recent versions, provided Java has been installed. The version of Java included in this package is for Windows users, so it will not work for you. Instead, go to Adoptium or Oracle to download a Mac version of Java. Also, since Aspyr updated the Mac port of SimCity 4 to be a 64-bit application, the 4GB Patch is NOT required for Mac users. One quirk to note is that NAM network items in TAB Loops will require the user to press Ctrl-TAB or Ctrl-Shift-TAB to cycle through, rather than the mere TAB or Shift-TAB on other operating systems (or the earlier Mac version), in order to access all the items available under each menu button.
How much hard drive space will the NAM require?
It depends on the options you install, but it can range anywhere from 1.7MB to about 1GB.
Will this mod impact game performance?
With modern hardware (as of 2022), any performance impact will be minimal\u0026ndash;the most prominent impact is that the game may initially be slower to load upon first opening it, particularly if you are running a full installation.
What all is included in the NAM?
Check out the Content Overview page for a brief look, and the full Features section of this documentation for a more in-depth look. The contents of the latest version can be found in the History section.
Is this mod stable?
The NAM has been around for over 18 years, and is the most widely-used mod for SimCity 4 Deluxe/Rush Hour. While there are always things in the NAM that are being improved, it has such wide acceptance because it is generally considered to be a stable addition to the game. If you encounter issues while using the mod, the NAM Team would like to know, as we want to ensure users of this mod have an enjoyable experience.
Is using this mod considered cheating?
The consensus of most SC4 players is that it is not. The NAM restores the traffic simulator to something much more in line with what Maxis originally intended, before they were forced to significantly down-tune it in order to allow the game to run on a 500MHz Pentium III. While the NAM does allow one to adjust the capacity of the simulator, potentially up to levels significantly higher than the base game, using the \u0026ldquo;Classic\u0026rdquo; setting, or customizing the capacity settings with the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT) can actually provide an experience that is more challenging than that offered by the base game. Many of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s expansions are designed to provide more options for managing one\u0026rsquo;s grid, and they are, to the greatest extent possible, designed to be functional additions, not cheats.
Is the NAM compatible with other transportation mods?
The NAM includes modifications to the Network Rule (\u0026ldquo;RUL\u0026rdquo;) files (which handle network placement) and the Traffic Simulator Exemplar. It is not compatible with any other mod that modifies these files. Aside from earlier versions of the NAM, there are very few of these files out there. Things like stations (e.g. for Ground Light Rail/Tram, High Speed Rail, etc.) and cosmetic mods (e.g. Euro textures, different streetlights, etc.) are compatible with the NAM. Older cosmetic mods not maintained by the team, however, may not have full coverage of all relevant NAM items.
Do I need to remove previous versions of the NAM and its related plugins?
Yes. This has changed since the release of NAM 37 in July 2020. The NAM\u0026rsquo;s contents are by default installed to the My Documents\\SimCity 4\\Plugins\\Network Addon Mod directory (on Windows, and similar directories on other OSes). NAM 31 through NAM 36 also utilized a \u0026ldquo;z___NAM\u0026rdquo; folder in that same Plugins directory, which should also be removed.
How do EA and Maxis feel about this mod? Is it legal?
The NAM is 100% legal, and EA Maxis has been extremely supportive of our efforts. Maxis employee Frank Simon (AKA MaxisFrank) actually encouraged NAM co-founder the7trumpets to undertake modification of the traffic simulator, as the company could not issue a patch themselves, due to the need to still meet the published minimum technical requirements.
What is this CAM thing? Is it related to the NAM?
The NAM and CAM (short for Colossus Addon Mod) are completely unrelated mods. The NAM deals with transportation networks, whereas the CAM affects the simulation of growable RCI buildings, by adding new growth stages. The still-available original version of the CAM (CAM 1.0, July 2007) does include an optional traffic simulator plugin, which is incompatible with the NAM\u0026rsquo;s traffic simulator plugins, and should not be installed if using the NAM. The CAM\u0026rsquo;s creators believe the current NAM simulator is vastly more suited to the CAM than the CAM traffic plugin. The traffic plugin was removed in the later CAM 2.x releases published by InvisiChem.
Are there any tutorials or videos that help explain this mod and its functionality?
Yes, there are some tutorials included in this documentation. There are also quite a few on the main SC4 forums, as well as on YouTube, but considering that the NAM has actually been around longer than YouTube (!), it is important to pay attention to the date of tutorial, as the NAM has changed significantly since the early days, and is still changing (particularly in light of the long-term project to move away from standard puzzle pieces)..
Does the NAM have dependencies?
The NAM requires zero dependencies. Since the NAM struck down its long-standing prohibition on including lots back in 2013, basic stations for some of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s additional rail-type network options are even part of the package now. If you are encountering the infamous \u0026ldquo;brown boxes\u0026rdquo; anywhere, they are the product of having a non-NAM mod or plugin installed, without all its dependencies.
Why is the game crashing to desktop immediately upon loading after installing this mod?
The only reason the NAM could cause an immediate crash to desktop (CTD) would be if you\u0026rsquo;re running the original version of SimCity 4 (not Deluxe/Rush Hour). If you are running Deluxe/Rush Hour, you may want to check any other plugins you may have installed.
What\u0026rsquo;s with all the acronyms? Is there a list of what they all mean?
Acronyms are omnipresent in the SC4 content world, and they serve a valuable purpose as shorthand. They can seem a bit arcane at first, however. The Glossary in this documentation contains all the pertinent NAM-related ones you may encounter.
Why are none of the icons showing up after I\u0026rsquo;ve installed the NAM?
You may not have installed the NAM correctly. See the Installation Instructions page.
Why am I seeing duplicate icons?
You may have two copies of a given plugin installed. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to find and remove the duplicate, which could be from an earlier NAM or NAM component plugin release, which could interfere with your NAM installation in other ways.
Why am I getting a red arrow/gray cursor when I click one of the new icons in game?
In most situations, this is an indication that you have the Controller file from an outdated NAM release, or an incompatible RUL-bound transit mod installed. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to remove the offending files. The one exception is with the little icon with the NAM logo at the bottom of the Highways menu\u0026ndash;this button is not meant to be pressed, but rather, hovered over to show version information. If the version information here says anything other than \u0026ldquo;45\u0026rdquo;, that\u0026rsquo;s a definite sign there\u0026rsquo;s an outdated/incompatible file lurking about your Plugins folder.
After installing the NAM, why are the tiles leading up to my intersections suddenly orange or red in the Congestion Data View?
The NAM\u0026rsquo;s traffic simulator plugin, with its default settings, amplifies the effect of the Intersection and Turn Capacity Effect property, affecting network tiles that are within a 2-tile radius of an intersection (or transition) to better simulate the effects of queues at intersections (esp. signalized ones). If you don\u0026rsquo;t like this effect, you can tweak it using the NAM Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT). Lowering the value of the \u0026ldquo;Intersection Capacity Effect\u0026rdquo; will diminish the redness of the tiles leading up to your intersections.
Why are the cars disappearing in game?
The \u0026ldquo;cars\u0026rdquo; are not really there in the traffic simulation\u0026ndash;they\u0026rsquo;re simply a visual effect that merely has a casual correlation to actual traffic data in the game. Being visual effects, they can eat up processing power, and in order to keep the game from becoming overloaded, the game\u0026rsquo;s engine puts a finite limit on how many vehicular automata can show up at one time. Over that limit, and they disappear. Certain plugin options for Automata Simulation can allow more automata to stay on the screen at one time, though keeping the cars on the road all the time is simply an impossibility, due to the way the game is programmed. SimCity 4 is a statistics-based simulator, not an agent-based simulator (as SimCity (2013) and Cities: Skylines are).
What are the differences between \u0026ldquo;puzzle pieces\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;FLEX pieces\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;starter pieces\u0026rdquo;, and TE lots\u0026quot;?
Puzzle pieces are ploppable network items, and are placed through the IntersectionOrdering RUL file (also known as RUL 0x10000000 or RUL-0). The interchanges included in the base game for the Elevated and Ground Highway networks are puzzle pieces. They are effectively static in their implementation\u0026ndash;once they are plopped, they cannot be altered without bulldozing. In effect, they are old dogs that cannot be taught new tricks.
Starter pieces are ploppable network items, usually small in size, which are designed primarily to initiate a network override, allowing any of the game\u0026rsquo;s draggable base networks to assume a new appearance and/or new functionality, often to the point of behaving like new networks. One simply places an instance of the starter piece, and drags the appropriate base network through the starter piece to initiate the override. The technique used to make them was first developed by smoncrie in 2006, and was first used in the implementation of Draggable Ground Light Rail (GLR) in the Version 21 release of June 2007. Examples of starter pieces can be found all throughout the NAM, particularly with the RealHighway (RHW) plugin, the Network Widening Mod (NWM), and the Street Addon Mod (SAM).
FLEX pieces might initially appear to be identical to puzzle pieces, as they are also ploppable items, but unlike garden variety puzzle pieces, they can be taught new tricks, and can change to better fit their surroundings, accepting input from starter pieces, or sometimes even acting as combination starter pieces/transitions. Examples of these include the Diagonal Street Helper Pieces, the Avenue Roundabouts, and many newer components in the RealHighway (RHW) system (almost all of which are prefaced by the term \u0026ldquo;FLEX\u0026rdquo; in their name). Because of this, a single FLEX piece can fulfill a range of functions that could otherwise require as many as 50 conventional puzzle pieces. The game also treats FLEX pieces more akin to draggable network items upon their placement in the game.
TE lots (short for transit-enabled lots) are lot-based items, also ploppable, but are not RUL bound, and are primarily intended to allow one\u0026rsquo;s sims to switch transit types (i.e. from being on a train to walking) or add some non-transit purpose to a particular stretch of a network. The most common uses of TE lots are transit stations and toll booths.
For more details, see here.
How do I move between the different puzzle/FLEX/starter pieces, and how do I rotate them? The TAB key will move forward through a given set of puzzle pieces under a single icon, and Shift-TAB will move backwards. Rotation is accomplished through the Home and End keys. For MacBook users, it\u0026rsquo;s actually Fn+Home and Fn+End.
What is up with the icon with the NAM logo at the bottom of the Highways menu, and why does it do nothing when I click it? The NAM logo icon is a diagnostic tool, which, if hovered over, will show you which version of the NAM controller you are currently running. This can be useful in diagnosing issues pertaining to the controller.
Why is the game crashing after I place a puzzle piece? This is a bug in the game itself, typically triggered by attempting to place conventional puzzle pieces in the vicinity of TE lots. If, in the process of constructing a puzzle piece, the footprint of the puzzle piece overlaps that of the TE lot, even before the puzzle piece is placed, the game generally does not understand the configuration, and will immediately crash. This is an issue within the game\u0026rsquo;s executable, and as a result, it was long deemed an unsolvable issue.
However, simmaster07 managed to decode enough of the framework that SimCity 4 uses to load DLL files from other sources, and was able to patch this issue with his SC4Fix.dll file. SC4Fix is available at Simtropolis. 27. Why isn\u0026rsquo;t it possible to add true new networks, instead of using starter pieces?
Adding new networks is, at this time, impossible. The base RHW network was only possible as it used an unused network stub left in the game. There are no more unused network stubs for us to use. The starter piece paradigm allows us to very closely mimic the effects of adding true new networks, however.
Why haven\u0026rsquo;t you guys added submenus instead of using TAB loops? Adding new submenus is, at this time, impossible. SC4 mod developers have tried for many years, to no avail.
Certain draggable items are not working for me, and I\u0026rsquo;m following the directions. Why isn\u0026rsquo;t it working? If you\u0026rsquo;re referring to starter pieces, make sure you\u0026rsquo;re dragging the specified default network out the correct end of the piece. Trying to \u0026ldquo;drag\u0026rdquo; the actual starter piece itself will get you nowhere. If you\u0026rsquo;re referring to a starter piece-based network extension not cooperating with a particular setup you\u0026rsquo;re trying to build, it may be that the setup is not supported. If you\u0026rsquo;re getting \u0026ldquo;blank\u0026rdquo; tiles upon drawing the item, this is generally a sign of improper installation and/or conflicting files being present in your Plugins.
My RCI demand seems to have changed since I installed the NAM. What is happening? The NAM does not directly affect RCI demand. It does not modify anything other than transportation-related files. You may have installed something else recently that does modify other parts of the game, however. Because the NAM is popular and a large-scale mod, many newer players who have installed other files at the same time mistakenly presume the NAM is at fault. Additionally, if you somehow unchecked too many boxes in the installer, it is possible you somehow caused the installer to skip installation of the Traffic Simulator plugin, which would cause the game to revert to the Maxis defaults.
I\u0026rsquo;m having difficulty using U-Drive-It (UDI) functionality on certain NAM items. Is there any way to fix this? It depends on the item\u0026ndash;Single-Track Rails (STR) and the various Turning Lane Avenue (TLA) options in the Network Widening Mod (NWM) are perhaps the most prone to issues. UDI was a last-minute addition to SimCity 4 Deluxe/Rush Hour, and is known for having a number of quirks. There really isn\u0026rsquo;t a way to fix them because of these quirks, though the TLA quirks can be mitigated by disabling \u0026ldquo;Snap To Road\u0026rdquo; and driving manually.
I\u0026rsquo;m from North America. Why aren\u0026rsquo;t the traffic signals so they\u0026rsquo;re on the far side of the intersection, as they are here? Can I change this? The way the game\u0026rsquo;s default traffic signals work with the stop point system on network path files, the signals have to be on the near-side in order to function. Some of the FLEX Turn Lane (FTL) options and Turn Lane Extension Pieces (TuLEPs) use trick stop points to allow for far-side signals, but there are feasible limits to this technique. Recently, however, there have been advances in signal modding, using true-3D props, which have allowed for offset props to be developed, getting around this issue. Offset props have not been released as of writing, but may potentially be made available as a third-party addition in the future.
I\u0026rsquo;m from a country where people drive on the left. Can I switch the side of the traffic signals? Yes. Check out the Signal Replacement Project, developed by NAM Team member MandelSoft. Please note that MandelSoft is no longer active in the SC4 community, and newer items may not be covered by that mod. It is not the NAM Team\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to update independent cosmetic mods.
Should I use the SC4 DatPacker or JDatPacker tools to consolidate my NAM installation into a single file? With the Mac version, it is effectively required to consolidate the mods files using JDatPacker, due to the \u0026ldquo;number-of-files limit\u0026rdquo; issue. With the Windows version, it will speed up load times, but you\u0026rsquo;ll need to ensure you remove the DatPacked files upon installing any NAM updates, or else they will interfere with the proper functionality of the update. Unless you also preserve your pre-DatPacked NAM installation, you will also be unable to use the NAM installer\u0026rsquo;s ability to install the same options when updating to a new version. As such, the NAM Team generally does not recommend that Windows users DatPack their installations.
How do I build an interchange with the RealHighway (RHW) system? Rather than the pre-fabricated, one-piece interchanges of the game\u0026rsquo;s default highway system, the RealHighway system was designed with the concept of modular interchange construction in mind. More details can be found in the RHW portion of the documentation. An upcoming release of the NAM will, however, change this at long last, as a series of FLEX-based pre-fabricated interchanges for the RHW system is in the works.
Why aren\u0026rsquo;t my neighbor connections working on RealHighways and/or wider Roads, Avenues and One-Way Roads? How do I fix them? Most RealHighways (except the RHW-2 and RHW-3 networks) and some multi-tile starter-based items require the use of special \u0026ldquo;Neighbor Connector Puzzle Pieces\u0026rdquo; (NCPPs) to function. For networks that are \u0026ldquo;combined\u0026rdquo;, having adjacent two-way traffic, simply drag the network to the edge of the city tile, as you normally would (ignoring the fact that the neighbor connection arrows both face the same direction), and plop the appropriate Neighbor Connection Puzzle Piece over it. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to do this on both sides of the neighbor connection. For one-way/\u0026ldquo;split\u0026rdquo; networks, follow the same directions, and if there is a gap between the two directions, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to place underground loop pieces next to the city edge, between the two carriageways.
Why are my RealHighway networks remaining at two lanes and ground level after dragging the network through one of the starter pieces? If your RealHighway starters are not working, and the network is remaining as the RealHighway-2 (RHW-2) after dragging through a starter, then this is likely a sign that you have the \u0026ldquo;LowRAM/NoRHW\u0026rdquo; version of the NAM Controller installed, which, as the name indicates, does not include any of the RUL2 code necessary for the RealHighway\u0026rsquo;s starters to function. Reinstall the mod with the Full version of the Controller, and ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements for the RealHighway plugin (4GB Patch installed, 64-bit operating system, and at least 4GB RAM).
Why can\u0026rsquo;t I build diagonal intersections with some of the wider Roads, Avenues and One-Way Roads? This functionality is still in the works, and will be added in a future release.
When is the next NAM version being released? There is no date or timeline for the next release. We honestly have no idea. This project is a very passionate hobby for many NAM Team members, but it is still just that\u0026ndash;a hobby, something we do in our spare time. It\u0026rsquo;s also a technically complex undertaking, where things can unexpectedly go wrong in development. It\u0026rsquo;s simply not possible for us to predict when we\u0026rsquo;ll be done with a release, and coming up with arbitrary release dates just leads to extremely buggy releases or postponement, disappointing everyone in the process. The one time we did it (in 2013), it did not go well. Besides, we like to surprise people.
I\u0026rsquo;m a user from outside the North America\u0026ndash;are there Euro road textures to make the roads look more familiar to me? Yes, just select either the \u0026ldquo;EU_Right Side\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;EU_Left Side\u0026rdquo; option (depending on your drive side) under \u0026ldquo;7_Texture and Drive Side Support\u0026rdquo;.
I have ideas for new features. Does the NAM Team take requests? Certainly. That said, being the transportation fiends we are, we probably want a lot of the same stuff you do, and there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance it\u0026rsquo;s either in development or planned.
I\u0026rsquo;d like to contribute to the NAM. How do I do so? As far membership on the NAM Team or the NAM Associates testing group goes, we\u0026rsquo;re always on the lookout for folks with the right skills on the forums. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to add something to the mod, show us a prototype of some sort\u0026ndash;we\u0026rsquo;ll help you figure out the best way to realize it. We don\u0026rsquo;t, however, have open sign-ups for development or testing positions.
Are you guys crazy, making this extensive mod for a 19-year-old game?! Yes. Always have been, always will be.

`}),e.add({id:6,href:"/docs/reference/nam-version-history/",title:"NAM Version History",description:"NAM Version History",content:"Agile Releases (2020 and later) # Version 44 (22 March 2022) # Hybrid Railway (HRW) Features: The Hybrid Railway system now features FA-2 Alt content, new textures to blend with the RealRailway (RRW) system, improvements to catenaries, and major improvements to Left-Hand Drive [LHD] support. RealHighway (RHW) x Avenue Features: The RealHighway (RHW) now has a FlexDDI system, allowing for FLEX-based Diverging Diamond interchanges with the Avenue network at ground level, and L1 and L2 elevations. Additionally, the FlexSPUI system now supports the L1 height level for the Type 120/Avenue configuration, along with stability improvements for all height levels. Both of these FLEX-based items can be found under a new button on the Roads menu. Additionally, the Avenue Type A1 and B1 MIS Ramp Interfaces have received draggable forms, following the same basic drag patterns as the RHW Type A1 and B1 Ramp Interfaces. RealHighway (RHW) Curves: new 90° draggable Mini-Curves have been added. The new 3x3 R1 90° Curves support the ground-level RHW-2, RHW-3, RHW-4, and MIS Ramp networks. The new 4x4 R1.5 90° Curves support the ground-level RHW-2, RHW-3, RHW-4, RHW-6S, and MIS Ramp networks. The RHW-6S also now supports the 5x5 R2 90° Curve configuration. MIS Ramp network support has been added to the FLEX S-Curve, and minor aesthetic improvements have been made to the L1 and above RHW-4 FLEX S-Curves. RealHighway (RHW) Transitions: 45° Curved FLEX Height Transitions at the R3 radius have been added, covering the RHW-2 (L0-L1), RHW-4 (L0-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4), and MIS Ramp (L0-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4) networks. Diagonal FLEX OnSlope (FLEX-OST) support has been added for the RHW-3 and RHW-6S networks. Additionally, further adjacency stability has been added to the 4x4 90° Curved FLEX Height Transitions. Bridges: New Viaduct Bridges have been added for Avenue (L0, L1, and L2), RHW-8S and RHW-10S (L1 and L2), and RealRailway (L0, L1, L2 for double track, L0 and L1 for single track). Flexible Turn Lane (FTL) Features: FLEX-based FTL Height Transitions have been added, including for the Type 120 Avenue (Ascending, L0-L1 and L0-L2\u0026ndash;use the FLEX Pieces for ramp-style transitions, or drag the FTL setup into the ground end of the On-Slope Transitions to transition the turn lanes to elevation), and RealHighway MIS-2 Lane (Descending, L1-L0, with FLEX Pieces for ramp-style transitions) configurations. Limited L1 and L2 Type 120 Avenue FTL support has been added (primarily for connecting to the L1 and L2 FlexSPUI). The Type 230 configuration for the Triple-Tile Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks has received draggable support for rail-type crossings, including Rail (both Dual and Single-Track), L1 and L2 Rail Viaducts, Standard and Rural Ground Light Rail (GLR), Elevated (Light) Rail, and Monorail. The MIS 2-Lane configuration has also received support for Avenue + and T-intersections (without FTLs), and One-Way Road intersections (with SITAP\u0026ndash;Signalization and Turn Arrow Project\u0026ndash;support, using the appropriate FLEX intersections). Additionally, Avenues can now end at T-intersections with the Road/NWM Type 110 configuration, with turn arrows provided by the new Avenue Type 020 FTLs. Streets and the Street Addon Mod (SAM): The draggable Diagonal S-Curves now work for SAM Sets 2 through 11. Network Widening Mod (NWM) x Street Addon Mod (SAM): Adjacency support for the Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks\u0026rsquo; intersections with the Street Addon Mod (SAM) sets has been vastly improved. FLEX Overpasses: The Road, One-Way Road (OWR), and Avenue networks have now received FLEX Overpasses, which allow for prefabricated orthogonal viaduct overcrossings of 1-4 tiles to be built. The length can be selected by using Home and End to rotate the overpass. Simply drag any orthogonal network underneath the FLEX Overpasses to cross below them. RHW Disconnector/NAM Eraser: The RHW Disconnector Tool has been rechristened the NAM Eraser, reflecting its ability to erase 1x1 network tiles of any network or network crossing combination. Additionally, it is also now available on all network menus. User Interface: The NAM\u0026rsquo;s menu buttons have been reworked, providing a cleaner image and, to improve internationalization (i18n), the English text has been removed from the icons themselves. The buttons have also been reordered, in an effort to improve the overall experience. Additionally, the old puzzle piece-based overpasses have been related to legacy status. Left-Hand Drive Support: Various improvements have been made across the board to LHD pathing. Morifari Victorian Stations: The Morifari Victorian Stations for Elevated Light Rail and Rail Viaducts have been restored, with some associated bugs fixed. Other Bugfixes: The RHW-10S will no longer flip improperly under Elevated RealRailway (ERRW) crossings. Diagonal x Diagonal (DxD) crossings involving the MIS Ramp and RHW-8C network have been improved. Pathing issues on the RHW-6C and RHW-8C FLEX Neighbor Connections have been addressed. Fixed the Euro textures on the RHW-6S Type A2 Wide ramp. The extraneous arrows on the RHW-2-to-4 and RHW-4-to-6C FLEX Width Transitions in LHD have been addressed. Drag-through issues involving the Triple-Tile-Thru x Dual-Tile-End FLEX T-intersections in the Flexible Turn Lanes (FTLs) have been fixed. Version 43 (24 December 2021) # The NAM Traffic Simulator (also known as \u0026ldquo;Simulator Z\u0026rdquo;) has been upgraded to Version 2.6.2, further refining pathfinding. Type 230 FLEX Turn Lanes (FTL) have been added for the triple-tile networks (TLA-7 and AVE-6) in the Network Widening Mod (NWM), allowing for dual left turns (or in Left-Hand Drive [LHD], dual right turns). Use the RealHighway (RHW) network tool to draw the center tile of this new FTL type. Additionally, the FLEX intersections for use with the wider FTL types have been improved. A number of new bridges have been added, including ones supporting the L1 and L2 elevated forms of the Road, One-Way Road, RHW-2, RHW-3, RHW-4, RHW-6S, and MIS Ramp networks . New curved switch, double-track median split (for use with overhanging stations), and L0/L1 \u0026ldquo;basketweave\u0026rdquo; FLEX pieces have been added to the Hybrid Railway (HRW) system, which allows for joint Rail and High Speed Rail (Monorail) traffic. Additionally, the HRW FLEX Height Transitions have been given their own button. Two new transit stations by ulisse99 have been added, the HRW Union Station (for Hybrid Railway) and the GLR Transit Hub (for Light Rail/Tram). Additionally, the transit switches for all recently-added stations have been updated, improving their functionality. The RealHighway (RHW) system has received an initial round of FLEX Turn Lanes (FTLs), covering the RHW-2 (Type 110), RHW-4 (Type 120\u0026ndash;built by overriding the Type 110 transition with an RHW-4), and MIS Ramp (2-Lane) networks. Additionally, FLEX-based SITAP (Signalized Intersection and Turn Arrow Project) support has been added to the base RHW-2 network, with all new FTL intersections (except Street intersections) supporting signalized and unsignalized forms. All such items can be found under the RHW FLEX Turn Lanes button, on the Highways menu. The One-Way Road version of SITAP has been given FLEX intersections and a new FLEX transition/starter (OWR Type 020), which allows the turn lane arrows to be extended by the user. All of these items can be found under the FLEX Turn Lanes button, under the Roads menu. Additionally, Left-Hand Drive (LHD) support for SITAP has been improved. A transition from the Network Widening Mod (NWM)\u0026rsquo;s RD-4 network to the Type 120 FLEX Turn Lanes (FTLs) has been added. A new draggable version of the OWR-3-to-OWR-5 transition in the NWM has been added. Two new FLEX items have been added to the RealRailway (RRW) system: a double-track median split (for use with overhanging stations), and an L1-L2 ramp-style height transition. Additionally, the orthogonal 1-Level FLEX On-Slope now supports L1-L2 transitions. The RealHighway (RHW) FLEX-based Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) in all radii (R1-R5), as well as the FLEX S-Curve, now all support the L0 RHW-3 network. Draggable stub-to-stub Height Transitions have been added for many RHW networks (except the base RHW-2). To construct, click over one of the stubs with the Elevated (Light) Rail tool to prevent the RHW\u0026rsquo;s normal auto-connect behavior, thereby allowing the transition overrides to initiate. An issue causing the old RHW-2, MIS, and RHW-4 Flexible Underpass (FLUPs) Overcrossing Puzzle Pieces (from the Roads x RHW button on the Roads menu) has been addressed. Since this issue was the result of an Instance ID conflict with the new RHW-3 and RHW-4 FLEX FLUPs Portals, any existing RHW-3 and RHW-4 FLEX FLUPs Portal will need to be rebuilt, by simply clicking over the portal with the RHW network tool. Additionally, the preview models for the FLEX-FLUPs Road and One-Way Road Portals have been corrected, and all portals should now function properly in LHD. Some directional flip issues with multi-tile Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks crossing under elevated RealHighway (RHW) networks have been addressed. A conflict between the Road Roundabouts and the Network Widening Mod (NWM) that was preventing T-intersections involving two triple-tile networks has been resolved. An issue in which the \u0026ldquo;strict\u0026rdquo; version of the RealRailway (RRW) Slope Parameters would be installed regardless has been fixed. The streetlight placement on the Draggable Road Viaducts (L1 and L2 Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue) has been improved. Holiday Bonus: A special holiday highway sign by Lucario Boricua is available in the NAM 43 download. Simply move NAM_Christmas_Sign.dat into your Plugins folder and look for the new sign under the Misc Transit Menu to enjoy. Version 42 (24 August 2021) # The long-awaited 3-Level Crossings for the RealHighway (RHW) system have been added. The Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks now have vastly improved stability, including in tight situations. Note that some intersections have been rotated as part of this process, and may appear to be in the wrong position upon loading. Simply clicking these situations with the appropriate network tool with re-orient them. RHW FLEX Width Transitions (FLEX-WTs) are now available, supporting over 200 possible network configurations with only 5 FLEX Pieces, with vastly improved slope tolerance. To use the FLEX-WTs, simply connect the desired networks into each end of the transition. The RHW FLEX Height Transitions (FLEX-HT) have been expanded to include a new 1-Level 90° Curved version, which presently supports L0-L1 RHW-2, L0-L1 MIS, and L0-L1 RHW-4. RHW FLEX Neighbor Connectors (FLEX-NCs) are now available, supporting every RHW network, including the L1-L4 elevated networks. An RHW Basketweave FLEX Piece has been added, allowing for ramp crossings in tight quarters, presently for L0 and L1 RHW-4. An RHW FLEX S-Curve has been added, allowing support for L0-L2 RHW-2 and L0-L4 RHW-4. Draggable Smooth Diagonal S-Curves have been added to the Road, One-Way Road, OWR-1, RHW-2, and MIS networks, along with the ability to make a Street version via the existing Diagonal Street FLEX/Helper Pieces. The Road Roundabouts have been overhauled, with revamped textures, a new center island prop, and support for new intersection combinations with Road, Street, One-Way Road, RHW-2, and MIS. The NAM\u0026rsquo;s Bridge system has undergone a revamp, with a new file architecture, a new OWR-3 Thru Truss bridge, various cosmetic fixes for bridges at various lengths, and pathing corrections to the RHW-6S Compact Box Girder. Several new large, multi-line stations for the Hybrid Railway (HRW) and RealRailway (RRW) networks have been added. The Diagonal Streets textures have been revamped. Stop-controlled \u0026ldquo;rural\u0026rdquo; intersections have been added: Road x Road +, Road x Road T, Avenue x Road +, Avenue x Road T (Avenue-Thru/Road-End), FTL Type 110 x Road +, and FTL Type 110 x Road T (FTL-Thru/Road-End). To add stop control, transition a Road to Street one tile before an intersection, and then cross/intersect it with Street. Limited support was provided for these in previous recent releases, and any such existing intersections will need to be rebuilt. A long-standing issue with the RHW-8S Type E1 ramps, when overridden from the bottom of the ramp, has been corrected. The Canal Addon Mod (CAN-AM) now has improved automata generation, as well as improvements to station functionality. The RRW Slope and Tunnel Parameters section now has three options: Maxis Default (which now changes the tunnel models to match the RRW), Moderate (the new default), and Strict (the only option previously). Various stability issues with the ERRW Viaduct crossings with RHW networks have been addressed. A shell script has been added to the installation package, to improve the user experience on Linux (thanks to Durfsurn. Various LHD path fixes for the RRW and Avenue Roundabouts have been incorporated. The draggable form of the RHW-8S Type D2 Wide ramp has been stabilized. An option to remove \u0026ldquo;legacy\u0026rdquo; RHW menu buttons from the Highways menu has been added, along with general Highways menu improvements. The \u0026ldquo;Compact\u0026rdquo; RHW-6C-to-4 Transition Puzzle Piece has been disabled from the Legacy Width Transitions menu, due to conflict with other items. The Single-Tile Roundabouts have undergone revision, and may need to be rebuilt in existing cities. Version 41 (24 April 2021) # Note: in order to ensure proper installation of NAM releases using the current installer, please remove the \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod\u0026rdquo; folder (and if still present, \u0026ldquo;z___NAM\u0026rdquo; folder) from the Plugins directory (usually My Documents\\SimCity 4\\Plugins on Windows) before installing a new NAM version. The Cleanup/Cleanitol functionality is not presently designed to remove full NAM installations. The RealExpressway (REW) system for the One-Way Road network has been reimplemented and expanded. In addition to the previous Draggable Ramp Interfaces (DRIs), new FLEXRamps and Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) have been added, and options for new, more consistent Avenue-style striping for all the One-Way Road networks have been added. The new FLEXRamps available include the Orthogonal and Diagonal OWR-2 Type A1 (Orthogonal overrideable with OWR-1), Orthogonal, Diagonal, and Curved OWR-2 Type B1 (Orthogonal overrideable with OWR-1), Orthogonal and Diagonal OWR-2 Type D1, Orthogonal OWR-3 Type D1, Orthogonal OWR-2 Type E1, and Orthogonal OWR-3 Type E1. MRCs supported include R1-R5 radii for OWR-2, R1-R3 for OWR-1, and R2-R5 for OWR-3. Note that in order to combat hardcoded \u0026ldquo;Tidal Flow\u0026rdquo; issues, the FLEX-based REW items are bidirectionally pathed, and use special network flags that do not allow them to be overplopped on existing stretches of One-Way Road. The SAM-to-SAM and SAM-to-Street Transitions for the Street Addon Mod (SAM) have been revamped, stabilized, and expanded, adding wealth texture support, new support for SAM Set 1, and improved support for SAM Set 11. The new Subway-based FLUPs system has been revamped to be easier to use. New underground starter pieces for the URoad-2, URoad-3, URamp, and URoad-4 (underground equivalents of the RHW-2, RHW-3, MIS, and RHW-4, respectively) have been added, and can be placed directly over top of Subway, allowing the network to be converted with a simple click of the Subway tool afterward. The starters at the ends of the FLUPs Portals have been removed, making construction\u0026ndash;particularly involving side-by-side RHW-4 portals\u0026ndash;far less temperamental. More details can be found in the Flexible Underpasses (FLUPs) Feature Guide. A conflict between the new FLUPs and the old, legacy RHW FLUPs Crossing Puzzle Pieces (particularly the RHW-2 and RHW-4 crossings) has been resolved. Note that any old RHW-2 and RHW-4 FLUPs Crossing Puzzle Pieces will need to be rebuilt. The Rails and Misc Transit menus have been revamped, to bring the base networks back up to the top of the menu. A pathing issue preventing traffic from utilizing the center tile on RHW-6C and RHW-8C crossings involving the Road and One-Way Road Draggable Viaducts has been resolved. The RHW Diagonal FLEXHeight Transitions (FLEX-HT) should now properly support L3-L4 MIS and L3-L4 RHW-4. A new FLEX Piece has been added to the Avenue intersections button, allowing two Streets to intersect an Avenue without crossing. Being FLEX-based, it also supports SAM Streets. The RHW Orthgonal Type E1 FLEXRamps and DRIs should no longer automatically produce RHW-3 out the top of the ramp\u0026rsquo;s mainline, improving overall stability with other networks. A glitch involving intersections following Dual Slip Lanes off the Type 110 FLEX Turn Lanes (FTLs) has been resolved. Fractional Angle Road intersections with the Street network now feature improved textures by Jiwoahn. Version 40 (1 April 2021) # The installation package has been refined to minimize the potential for Windows users failing to properly install the 4GB Patch and having the game crash to desktop (CTD) as a result\u0026ndash;the #1 tech support issue with recent NAM releases. A new batch file has been introduced to automate the process of applying the 4GB Patch to the game\u0026rsquo;s executable (special thanks to CorinaMarie), and installation options for \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; versions of the NAM Controller have been added for users who on Windows XP and other 32-bit operating systems, and/or have less than 4GB RAM. (The Mac version, being 64-bit, does not require the 4GB Patch.) Windows users should begin the installation process with \u0026ldquo;NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version40.bat\u0026rdquo; instead of the .jar file. Draggable Slip Lanes are now possible at Orthogonal x Diagonal (OxD) intersections involving base Streets, Roads, One-Way Roads, and Avenues. Simply drag the One-Way Road tool between the intersecting networks at the appropriate corner to make the connection. About 40 new ramp interfaces have been added to the RealHighway (RHW) system, including Diagonal Type A1 and B1 ramps for all ground networks, Diagonal Type D1 and E1 for the L0 RHW-2, RHW-3, RHW-4, RHW-6S, RHW-8S, RHW-8C, and RHW-10S, along with Orthogonal Type D1 and E1 ramps for the L0 RHW-3. Additionally, the D1 and E1 ramps have been rebased from RHW-4 to RHW-3, improving override stability in the process. The new Subway-based FLUPs system has been expanded to include entrance/exit portals for the RHW-3 and RHW-4 networks, along with underground ramp interfaces for all present networks. Additionally, some path jumping issues with certain NWM overrides of the FLEX Overcrossing Pieces (FLEX-OCPs) have been corrected. Small 90° Curve (2x2) support has been expanded. The Road Small 90° can now accept overrides from the Road-based Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks (TLA-3, AVE-2, ARD-3, and NRD-4), and One-Way Road Small 90° Curves are now supported as well, which allow overrides from the NWM\u0026rsquo;s OWR-1 and OWR-3. It is now possible to build Diverters for Road, Street, and (same type) SAM +-intersections, allowing one to divert thru traffic and convert the intersections into pairs of Small 90° Wide Radius Curves, while still allowing Pedestrian usage. For instructions on the build process, please consult the Base Features Guide in the main documentation package. All of the override networks included in the Network Widening Mod (NWM) can now form Orthogonal x Orthogonal (OxO) + and T-intersections with Street Addon Mod (SAM) Sets 2 through 11. The Auto-Destruct Hole Diggers and Raisers have been expanded to include smaller increments\u0026ndash;0.1 meters, 0.5 meters, 1 meter, 2 meters, and 5 meters. The Orthogonal RHW FLEX On-Slope Transitions (FLEX-OSTs) have undergone further refinement. The Diagonal RHW FLEX Height Transitions (FLEX-HTs) now support overrides for higher elevations of the RHW-4 and MIS Ramp networks (L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4). The Network Widening Mod (NWM) is once again referred to by its original name in the installer, rather than as \u0026ldquo;Additional Widths and Turn Lanes\u0026rdquo;. The newer overrideable versions of the Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) for Road now have proper Euro textures. The stability of the OWR-1 override of the RIRO/LILO (Right/Left In, Right/Left Out) Slip Lanes has been improved. Stability improvements have been made to the Type 220 x Type 220 T-Intersection in the FLEX Turn Lane/QuickTurn system. Issues with the Single-Tile Roundabouts allowing the network to drag out the incorrect side (and not out the correct side) in Left-Hand Driving (LHD) mode have been addressed. and T-intersections involving One-Way Road-based \u0026ldquo;Boulevards\u0026rdquo; (a configuration in which two One-Way Roads are separated by a one-tile median) no longer inadvertently convert into One-Way Road Roundabouts. Minor file architecture improvements have been made to prevent installation errors involving the Legacy Auto Avenue Turn Lanes and Legacy Semi-Auto Road Turning Lanes, which would lead to blank intersections and approaches at Avenue x Avenue and Road x Road intersections\u0026ndash;the #2 tech support issue in recent NAM releases. A long-standing missing texture glitch with the L1-L4 RHW-4 Type E1 ramps has been corrected. An adjacency glitch involving the RHW-2 connection to the One-Way Road Roundabouts when next to a Diagonal Road connection has been addressed. Various other minor stability improvements have been made to the RHW, NWM, and HRW (Hybrid Railway) RUL2 override code. Version 39 (3 December 2020) # New Subway-based draggable implementation of the Flexible Underpass (FLUPs) system added, with FLEX-based network portals (modeled by Girafe) and underground networks for the RealHighway\u0026rsquo;s RHW-2 and MIS networks. These portals include working nightlights, and options for both Maxis Nite and Dark Nite (selectable under the \u0026ldquo;Texture and Drive Side Support\u0026rdquo; section of the installer). Three new draggable \u0026ldquo;Alternate Viaduct\u0026rdquo; styles added for the Road Viaducts\u0026ndash;Stone Arch, Steel Arch, and Japanese (JPN) Facelift. These new viaducts act as separate networks, and are designed specifically for use as part of short oorthogonal overpasses over orthogonal networks, starting from On-Slope Transitions. Additionally, the Alternate Viaducts can be overridden by the Street network and some SAM types. A FLEX On-Slope transition (FLEX-OST) has been added for the Hybrid Railway (HRW) FLEX-based dual-network. FLEX On-Slope Transitions (FLEX-OSTs) for the RealHighway (RHW) plugin have been fixed, and now function as intended. Support for 90° R1 \u0026ldquo;Mini-Curves\u0026rdquo; (3x3 footprint) has been added for the Road network. Diagonal crossover paths and DIPs (Distilled Intersection Paths) have been added to the diagonals for the Wider RHW networks (courtesy of McDuell and Triple-Tile NWM networks (courtesy of Ganaram Inukshuk), improving capacity and functionality of the diagonal RHW-8S, RHW-10S, RHW-6C, RHW-8C, TLA-7, and AVE-6 networks. Various improvements have been made to the NWM TLA-7/AVE-6-to-Dual-OWR-3 draggable transition, including the addition of proper Distilled Intersection Paths (DIPs) to mitigate capacity issues, along with fixing broken LHD pathing The RULs for the LHD version of the FLEX Turn Lanes (FTL) Type 130 x Type 110 intersections have been improved, to eliminate previous texture and path flipping errors. Version 38 (3 September 2020) # The L1 (Level 1, 7.5m height) Draggable Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue Viaducts can now form diagonal crossings with the following networks: Street, Road, One-Way Road, Avenue, Rail, Single-Track Rail (STR), Ground Light Rail (GLR), Elevated Light Rail, Monorail, L0 RHW-2, L0 RHW-3, L0 MIS, L0 RHW-4, L0 RHW-6S, L0 RHW-8S, L0 RHW-10S, L0 RHW-6C, L0 RHW-8C, and L1 MIS. Adjacency stability has been dramatically improved for all L1 Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue Viaduct crossings, and Diagonal FLEX Height Transitions have been added. Diagonal FLEX Height Transitions (FLEX-HT) for the RHW-2, MIS, and RHW-4 have been added (all L0-L1 only). Note that the RHW-2 version does not automatically produce L1 RHW-2 by dragging out the top\u0026ndash;a change that has been extended to the Orthogonal FLEX-HT as well, to improve stability. The Hybrid Rail (HR) FLEX Piece system has been added. Hybrid Rail tracks allow both Passenger Rail and Monorail/High Speed Rail traffic (designed for use with the future Real High Speed Rail (RHSR)), and also feature overhead catenaries. Stations, switches, and a base set of L1 Viaducts have been included. Transitions between different Street sets in the Street Addon Mod (SAM) plugin are now possible, thanks to the addition of a new FLEX Transition piece. New Single-Tile Roundabout FLEX Piece added. The Single-Tile Roundabout allows for connections to Road and Street, and as the name indicates, takes up less room than the NAM\u0026rsquo;s other Roundabout options. The Road Roundabouts have become more flexible, allowing double corner connections. Stability and pathng improvements have also been made. The diagonals for the Wider RHWs have received stability coding improvements. In addition, a capacity issue with the RHW-6C and RHW-8C diagonals has been addressed. The RHW Disconnector now covers all possible network combinations (including Non-RHW Combinations), allowing for more gentle bulldozing of any network setting. A multitude of pathing issues have been addressed, including a number of paths dating back to the original game, which had somehow escaped both Maxis and the NAM Team for the past 16 years. Some of the overridable Road Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) added in NAM 37 have been migrated to new Instance IDs (IIDs) and may need to be rebuilt. This change is designed to better accomodate future expansion of One-Way Road Multi-Radius Curve and Fractional Angle capabilities. The GLR/Tram-in-Road and GLR/Tram-on-Street stations have been restored. Version 37 (2 July 2020) # The NAM has switched over to a new Java-based installer designed by daeley, with cross-platform support for any operating system that supports the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The RealHighway (RHW) system has undergone a massive code overhaul (\u0026ldquo;Mark IV\u0026rdquo;), greatly improving stability, especially in compact situations. Diagonal x Diagonal (DxD) crossings (grade-separated) between wider RHW networks should now be possible in most situations. The RealRailway (RRW) system is now the default (and only) option for the Rail network. Users wishing to retain the original Maxis Rail should download the separate Maxis Rail Legacy Plugin. Various cosmetic/legacy plugins, such as the Bullet Train Mod (BTM) and El-Rail Alternate Implementation, are no longer directly available within the main NAM download, due to crosslink and support issues. They will be available as separate downloads, as Legacy Plugins with no guarantee of support or further upgrades. An initial basic version of the RealExpressway (REW) mod is now available. A pathing issue affecting intersections with the Diagonal Streets Plugin, dating back to NAM 20 (!) has now been fixed (thanks to McDuell). RRW Fractional Angle and FlexTrack switch content can now be constructed using easier-to-use FLEX Pieces, rather than memorizing drag/draw patterns. Some limited Fractional Angle elevated support is now available. The Road-based Single-Tile and Dual-Tile Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks now support Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs). For the single-tile networks, override the base Road MRCs with the appropriate NWM network to convert them, and use the dedicated pieces for the dual-tile versions (the RD-6 uses an override of the TLA-5 version\u0026ndash;place Road stubs to fill in the \u0026ldquo;bites\u0026rdquo; on the RD-6 R4 curve). L3 and L4 FLEXFly pieces are now available for the RHW. RHW FlexSPUI has been redesigned, with improved support for the current array of RHW networks. Support for L0 and L2 is present (use the legacy TuLEP OnSlope to connect to the L2 version). Orthogonal TLA-3 and AVE-2 connections to the One-Way Road Roundabouts are now supported. Three new RHW FLEXRamps are now supported: Type D1-Inside (RHW-4 base), Type E1-Inside (RHW-4 base), and Type D1-Inside Dual Shift (RHW-6C base). Additionally, L1 and L2 support has been added to the Type A2 ramps for the RHW-8C and RHW-10S networks, and the L1 and L2 versions of the RHW-3 network now support Type A1 and B1 ramps. Various \u0026ldquo;tidal flow\u0026rdquo;-related pathing issues with the Draggable Elevated One-Way Road Viaducts have been addressed. File encoding issues with certain NAM files that have been known to cause crash-to-desktop (CTD) errors with Aspyr\u0026rsquo;s new 64-bit macOS port of SimCity 4 (currently just the App Store version) have been fixed. A new bridge has been added for the NWM\u0026rsquo;s NRD-4 network. Changes introduced since the NAM 37 Release Candidate of 23/24 April 2020: # The new FlexSPUI V2 now works properly in LHD mode. Drag pattern interference between the new draggable Road Small 90° Curve and the Road Long FA3 (71.6°) curve has been eliminated. Issues with various RHW and NWM bridges have been addressed, including the RHW-4 Small Steel Arch, the RHW-6S Concrete Arch Dual, and the NRD-4 Thru Truss. The accidentally-omitted DDRHW-4 bridge has also (again) be re-added. Missing textures/paths on some RHW T-intersections involving diagonals have been addressed. New draggable Road curves (Small 90° and Small S) have received Euro texture support. Issues involving the L1 RHW-8C crossings over Avenue have been addressed. Pathing for the RHW-3-to-ARD-3 transition has been fixed. The texture for the OWR-3 x OWR-2 +-intersection has been rotated to the correct direction. Tidal flow issues with the Slip Lane functionality, causing paths to not function in certain directions (esp. in LHD) have been fixed. Various Euro texture issues with the RHW-8C Type D1 ramp have been fixed. The OWR-1-to-MIS transition has been fixed. Avenue-to-MIS transitions have been fixed. Both US and EU textures for the RHW-6C and 8C Type D1 Dual Shift Inside FLEXRamp have been fixed. Various fixes have been made to the RealRailway (RRW) network. Pathing fixes have been made to the draggable Wide-Radius Curve (WRC)/Multi-Radius Curve (MRC) and Fractional Angle (FA) functionality. TLA Center Turn Arrow cosmetic mod now installed as option under Texture and Drive Side options, fixing previous file architecture issues. Mac-only issues with GHSR network showing Monorail supports have been fixed. Some INRUL-based issues with the RRW FlexTrack system have been addressed, particularly with the J2 Turnout (Ortho-to-FARR-1.33/1.5). Note that these changes have altered the availability of some drag patterns, and clicking on some existing switches may break them. Such switches will need to be rebuilt using their FLEX Piece equivalent. Note that no new features have been added since the NAM 37 Release Candidate. Addition of new content will resume with NAM 38 development. Monolithic Releases (2013 through 2017) # Version 36 (13 September 2017) # New FLEX Turn Lanes (FTL) feature added, providing a more intuitive and flexible alternative to the old Turn Lane Extension Pieces (TuLEPs, now deprecated). Draggable Elevated RealRailway (RRW) viaducts added at L1 (7.5 meter) and L2 (15 meter) heights. One-Way Road Signalized Intersection and Turn Arrow Project (SITAP) expanded to cover intersections with FLEX Turn Lanes and Road-based multi-tile NWM networks. Street Addon Mod (SAM) Set 11 - IndustrieSAM by mgb204 added, providing a new, industrial-style Street texture. Draggable Wide-Radius Curve functionality added to all applicable Street Addon Mod (SAM) override networks. RealRailway (RRW) FlexTrack functionality expanded to cover additional setups. R5 radius Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) added to the Road network. Diagonal FLEX On-Slope Transitions added to the RHW, supporting 1 and 2-level transitions for the RHW-2, RHW-4, and MIS networks. R4 and R5 radii Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) added to the RealHighway (RHW) system, with support for the L0 RHW-2, L0 RHW-4, and L0 RHW-6S netwoks. Overlap ability also added to the ground-level R2 curves for the RHW, allowing for smoother loop ramps. Diagonal MIS Connection support added to the One-Way Road Roundabouts. Texture glitch fixed with the Euro version of the L1-L4 RHW-6S Type A2 FLEXRamps/DRIs. Minor pathing fix to improve zone access on the TLA-7 network in the Network Widening Mod (NWM). The compression scheme on the NAM Installer has been changed, making it such that the external 7-Zip SFX layer surrounding it is no longer needed. New edition of the NAM documentation started, marking a return to the HTML format used prior to the NAM 31.x releases of 2013. Please note that due to the incredible scope of the mod, and the amount of time to adequately document features, that some sections may remain in an incomplete state. Version 35 (4 November 2016) # New RealRailway (RRW) FlexTrack functionality, including draggable Fractional Angle Railroads (FARR) at three angles (FA-2, FA-3, and FA-1.33/1.5) and improved Single-Track Rail (STR) support. Vastly improved adjacency stability for ramp-style RealHighway (RHW) FLEX Height Transitions, including many adjacencies with FLEXRamps and Draggable Ramp Interfaces (DRIs). Several new draggable NWM transitions: NRD-4-to-ARD-3, NRD-4-to-Avenue, NRD-4-to-TLA-5, NRD-4-to-RD-4, Road-to-RD-4, TLA-3-to-Avenue, TLA-3-to-TLA-5, AVE-2-to-TLA-5, AVE-2-to-Avenue, TLA-7/AVE-6-to-Dual-OWR-3, OWR-4-to-RHW-8S, OWR-5-to-RHW-10S, and OWR-1-to-MIS. These transitions can either be built through the stub method, or (in case of different base networks), direct connection. At-grade intersection support for the Road, OWR, and Avenue Viaducts, plus other stability and cosmetic improvements. Multi-Radius Curve (MRC) functionality added to the L1 and L2 RHW-2. A number of path fixes involving elevated RHW networks. Support for at-grade RHW-4 x Avenue, RHW-3 x Avenue and MIS x Street intersections (OxO only), as well as improvements and additions to RHW-2 and MIS diagonal intersections with Maxis surface networks. Proper P57-era RHW support for Moonlinght\u0026rsquo;s Alternate El-Rail and Bullet Train (Shinkansen) mods (OxO only). Various fixes to the Maxis Highway Override (MHO), including improved RealRailway (RRW) support, support for moonlinght\u0026rsquo;s Alternate El-Rail and Bullet Train, and Level Bridges for both L0 and L2 MHO networks. Re-implementation of some multi-tile RHW and NWM starter pieces, to improve stability in preparation for future additions. Legacy code has been added to provide stability to older, unconverted starters. Version 34 (25 December 2015) # The Tram-in-Avenue (TiA), Tram-in-Road (TiR), Tram-on-Road (ToR), and Tram-on-Street (ToS) dual networks are now partially draggable. To activate the dual networks, click the Elevated Rail tool over Avenue for TiA, the Elevated Rail tool over Road for TiR, the Rail tool for ToR, and the Elevated Rail tool on Street for ToS. Elevated RealHighway (RHW) networks and draggable Elevated Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue Viaducts can now form overpasses over Tram-in-Avenue, Tram-in-Road, Tram-on-Road, and Tram-on-Street dual networks. Simply drag the crossing network up to the edge of the Tram Dual-Network to form a stub, and begin dragging from stub on the other side of the Tram Dual-Network to continue the network. Some support for networks besides RHWs and the Road Viaducts has also been added, using similar means. RealHighway crossings over Network Widening Mod networks are now vastly more stable. Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) for the Road network have been added in draggable form, in four different radii (R1-R4). Signalized intersections for One-Way Roads are now possible in the initial phase of the OWR Signalization and Turn Arrow Project (SITAP), complete with turn arrows before the intersection (NOTE: LHD functionality for this feature may still be limited). These signals cannot automatically appear, due to the game\u0026rsquo;s handling of One-Way Road mechanics, but can be activated by transitioning from One-Way Road to Road just before the intersection. For intersections between two One-Way Roads, it is necessary to click over the resultant 90-degree Road bend with the One-Way Road tool. +-intersections and T-intersections between One-Way Roads and Roads, One-Way Roads, Avenues, and +-intersections (no T-intersections) with single-tile Road-based NWM networks (TLA-3, AVE-2, ARD-3, NRD-4) are available. 7 new bridges by eggman121 have been added, including the first-ever NWM bridges for the RD-4 and RD-6 networks, plus a new RHW-4 bridge, and four RealRailway (RRW) bridges. FLEX On-Slope Transitions for the Elevated Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue Viaducts have been improved to support tighter situations, where a network is directly below the elevated end of the transition. Many Elevated RHW base network features now show preview textures. An issue with High Speed Rail crossings over wider ground-level RHW networks has been addressed. An issue preventing the proper override of the ramp interfaces on L1 RHW QuickChanges has been fixed. Some clickaround may still be necessary to force the overrides to continue. Version 33 (26 November 2015) # Massive update to the Draggable Ramp Interface (DRI) and FLEXRamp systems in the RealHighway (RHW) Mod. 90% of all previous static puzzle piece ramps have been given easier-to-use FLEX and/or draggable counterparts, and a plethora of new ramp interfaces for elevated RHW networks are now available, Wealth textures are included for ground level versions. The RHW FLEXFly system has been completely overhauled, and now includes 90-degree and 45-degree versions, in single and dual-lane configurations, at Ground Level (L0), 7.5m (L1), and 15m (L2) heights. The double-decker RHW-4 (DDRHW-4) has been lowered one level (from L2/L3 to L1/L2), increasing ease of use. The DDRHW-4 has also gained support for DRIs and FLEXRamps, including A1 and B1 Outside and Inside Ramps. Disconnector added, to simplify demolition of FLEX-based RHW pieces. Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs), in both draggable and FLEX form, have been added to the RealHighway Mod, in three different radii, for the RHW-2, MIS, RHW-4, and RHW-6S. Stability improvements to the FLEX Height Transitions. Major improvements to the RealRailway (RRW) plugin, which now supports most crossings. Transit station functionality and compatibility has been further improved. Minor fixes to other NAM components. New High Speed Rail Project (HSRP) textures, courtesy of vershner. Changes introduced since the NAM 33 Pre-Release of 29 July 2015: # The RealRailway (RRW) FlexTrack system makes an earlier-than-expected debut. See the FlexTrack User\u0026rsquo;s Guide in the Documentation folder for more details. PedMall functionality greatly enhanced with the addition of access paths to most non-Highway-type road networks, including NWM networks and Tram/El-Rail Dual-Networking items. Pedestrians may now directly access the PedMalls from these other networks without the need of a station or other transit-enabled lot/switch. Many custom bridges that previously blocked all ferry traffic have now been corrected. MandelSoft\u0026rsquo;s previous RHW texture sets, including Euro, Ontario, and Irish/South African textures, have been discontinued. A new standard Euro RHW set, based on the default US set, has been added as a replacement, and adds compatibility for all current RHW features. An issue with the NAM 33 Pre-Release in which the Controller Compiler would fail due to an XML read error has been fixed. Several overhanging texture issues with the new RHW ramp interfaces have been corrected. The R3 FLEX-Multi Radius Curve now rotates fully as intended. A number of Left-Hand Drive transit path file issues across the entire mod have been added or corrected for proper functionality. Version 32.1 [Mac-only] (28 June 2014) # Solved file encoding issues on Additional Bridges, High Monorail, and High Elevated Rail, which prevented the NAM from running on Universal Binary versions of the Aspyr Mac port of SimCity 4 Deluxe. Introduced an installer to NAM Mac version, using a Wineskin wrapper of the Windows installer. Addressed some other transportation-related issues present in the Aspyr Mac port. Version 32 (14 January 2014) # The NAM Elevated Viaducts for Roads, One-Way Roads, and Avenues are now available in a draggable form, at both Level 1 (7.5 meter) and Level 2 (15 meter) heights, complete with FLEX Height and On-Slope transitions. Overpass situations involving one or more diagonal networks are not yet supported. Elevated Rail-over-Avenue and Elevated Rail-over-NWM Road-4 dual-networking support has been added, complete with a new station supporting both networks. The initial phases of the RealRailway (RRW) system have been added. This feature must be selected as part of a custom install. The RealHighway (RHW) system has been expanded to include the QuickChange interchange system, which blends the RHW\u0026rsquo;s modularity with the ease of Maxis Highway construction techniques for certain situations, which will be expanded in future NAM releases. Additionally, several new types of FLEXRamps are available\u0026ndash;please read the instructions in the description text. FLEX Transitions have also been given stability improvements for certain situations. Coupled with the RHW system, the NAM now offers Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) functionality, including stations. Transit station functionality has been further improved, including the beginning of the implementation of the SLURP, which will gradually raise all transit stations to NAM standards. The NAM Controller Compiler has been included with the installer, with which it now communicates, ensuring that only the installed features are incorporated into the NAM Controller, reducing file size and load times. (The e-series and s-series controllers have been discontinued.) About 50 bugs reported since the start of the NAM 32 Pre-Release have also been squished, including some that had been present since earlier versions of the NAM. It is highly recommended that users update to the latest NAM in order to enjoy a more stable experience. Version 31.2 (4 June 2013) # Integration of 4GB Patch into installer, further preventing risk of CTDs on newer systems. Maxis Highway Custom Interchanges button re-enabled, after fixing HID re-index issue in RUL0 file. \u0026ldquo;Sinkhole-to-China\u0026rdquo; bugs fixed on several RealHighway (RHW) pieces. L2 RHW x RHW OxD Stability improved. Maxis Highway Override/\u0026ldquo;Project Symphony\u0026rdquo; Type A ramp is now able to be fully rotated. RHW-10S bridge no longer has issues with missing tiles. DDRHW-4 paths now at proper heights. Maxis Highway Override/\u0026ldquo;Project Symphony\u0026rdquo; no longer causes CTDs when dragged under High Speed Rail. Further improvements to RealHighway filler pieces. Maxis Highway Override/\u0026ldquo;Project Symphony\u0026rdquo; OxD crossing with Rail Viaducts now facing the correct direction on all tiles. Multiple \u0026ldquo;rainbow tile\u0026rdquo; issues fixed. Some files moved from Rail Viaducts to Base Contents, to address issue with \u0026ldquo;missing tiles\u0026rdquo; reported by users who did not install the viaducts. Several LHD path fixes for bridges. Under/overpass on starter situations improved for RHW starters. While the expanded RealHighway functionality available in the 31.x-series releases is much more stable in Version 31.2, issues still exist with the L1 and L2 Diagonal RHW-6C, 8C, 8S, and 10S, when crossing over other RealHighways. The overpass may behave as if it is prevented, or produce inexplicable results. Due to the complexity of the coding for any sort of crosslinking between two override networks (especially when one is multi-tile and diagonal), solving this issue is a veritable \u0026ldquo;needle in the haystack\u0026rdquo; situation, and will take substantial time to correct. Support will not be provided for issues involving these overpasses. Two multi-purpose transit stations by E-N of BriPizza have been added, serving the orthogonal intersections of almost all single-width networks that differ in height by 15m. The NAM Ideal Transit Switches (NITS) have been introduced. The NITS provide greatly increased efficiency for all combo NAM transit stations (e.g., all stations with subway access and at least one other major network), which results in greater network usage. Controller updated to version r184. Please note that the installer will \u0026ldquo;seek and destroy\u0026rdquo; old NAM installations in your Plugins, so there is no need to worry about uninstalling/deleting your old NAM. Version 31.1 (6 April 2013) # Controller divided into two different packages to improve stability\u0026ndash;the smaller \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;s-series\u0026rdquo;) package, and the larger \u0026ldquo;extreme\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;e-series\u0026rdquo;), to improve stability issues present with NAM 31. Road Turning Lanes \u0026ldquo;semi-automatic\u0026rdquo; functionality has changed implementation, from Rail overclick to One-Way Road overclick. A number of transit stations have had bugs fixed or performance otherwise enhanced, and several optional new stations have been added. For PC users, any stations plopped in your cities from NAM 31 will automatically be upgraded when you install NAM 31.1.For Mac users, the replacement set of basic Maxis stations had to be modified, along with the Modern El Train Station by Brenda Xne. These fixes were necessary due to a bug in the Mac version of SC4. If you\u0026rsquo;re a Mac user and you plopped any of these stations from the NAM using version 31, you will have to bulldoze them and replop them once you have installed NAM 31.1. New Street network functionality: Some new draggable wide-radius curves, and intersections along wide-radius curves, are now possible with the Street network. Credit for this new feature goes to Swordmaster from the NAM Team. RealHighway Filler Pieces have been restored and expanded after previous issues. Installing over previous versions: NAM 31.1 may be installed directly over top of any previous NAM releases. It is a full release, not a patch or a hotfix. All future updates are planned to be in full package form, and there are no plans to issue patches or hotfixes in the future. Please also note that the NAM Team only provides technical support for the most recent version, which, as of this document, is NAM 31.1. We cannot assist users of the original NAM 31 release, or NAM 30 (or earlier). Special Thanks: The NAM Team would like to thank the following members of the community, who have tested the penultimate build of the NAM 31.1 controller and given their feedback on its stability, and/or assisted with other controller-related tests after the NAM 31 release, in an effort to nail down the game stability issues: A Nonny Moose, dyoungyn, Joe 90, mgarcia, mneonnew, shanghai kid, spot, and txrailcat74. Version 31.0 (2 March 2013) # The NAM has changed to a \u0026ldquo;monolithic\u0026rdquo; package. With the exception of the Diagonal Bridge Enabler (DBE), all other separate-download NAM plugins have been merged into the main package, including the RealHighway Mod (RHW), the Railway Addon Mod (RAM), the Network Widening Mod (NWM), the High Speed Rail Project (HSRP), the Street Addon Mod (SAM), and the Rural Roads Plugin (RuRP). All NAM-issued bridges have also been incorporated into the package. These plugins may all be selected as options in the new and improved NAM installer. Substantial expansion of the RealHighway (RHW) Mod network options, including the addition of the full Multi-Height System, which allows four elevated heights-L1 (7.5m), L2 (15m), L3 (22.5m), and L4 (30m). All widths of the RHW also now have L1 and L2 elevated counterparts, and the RHW-4, RHW-6S, and MIS Ramps have L3 and L4 available. The RHW also now includes FLEX Height Transitions (FLEX-HT), FLEX On-Slope Transitions (FLEX-OST), FLEX Ramp Interfaces (FLEXRamps), accommodating many of the new networks without adding massive numbers of new puzzle pieces. Draggable Fractional Angle Roads have been added at two different angles-FA3 (18.4°/71.6°) and a new angle, FA2 (26.6°/63.4°). For the first time ever, the NAM now includes Lots, adding a basic variety of stations for NAM override networks that require them, including Ground Light Rail, the Tram/El-Rail Dual Networks, and High Speed Rail. Starter Pieces have now been converted to include a self-destructing construction lot, simplifying construction. Hole Diggers and Raisers have also been added in two forms: the conventional Lot-based approach, and a new self-destructing variant. Maxis Highway Override, AKA Project Symphony, has been added. This plugin converts the Maxis Highways from 6 undersized lanes, to 4 RHW-scaled lanes, and better allows the network to interface with RHW functionality. Wide Radius Curves added to the Monorail network. Moonlinght\u0026rsquo;s popular Alternate El-Rail Mod and Bullet Train (Shinkansen) Mod have been added as optional skins for the El-Rail and Monorail networks, respectively. Two new SAM sets have been added: the Klinker Streets by squidi, and moonlinght\u0026rsquo;s Japanese Streets. \u0026ldquo;Modular\u0026rdquo; Releases (2007 through 2011) # Version 30 (15 September 2011) # Elevated Road, One-Way Road and Avenue viaduct models have been revamped, with new orthogonal-to-diagonal curves added to One-Way Road and Avenue Viaduct sets.

Due to these adjustments, any existing items that made use of these adjusted items will be affected \u0026amp; may show as an invisible tile in-game. If this occurs, please bulldoze \u0026amp; rebuild the given intersection \u0026amp;/or section of network to correct the problem. The Structure of the NAM Folders \u0026amp; Installation Files has been modified. This has been done to better handle some of the additional plugins that this mod contains. Please see the Installation Instructions regarding installation. Diagonal Streets have now been added \u0026amp; currently exist as an additional optional plugin. The existing Street Network tool is used for this. Please note: This does not change the inherent functionality of the Street Tool. To trigger diagonal streets, simply zig-zag the street tool \u0026amp; the tiles will automatically change \u0026amp; update. Please note: As at the time of writing this particular item was currently in Beta still. Roundabouts have now been added \u0026amp; currently exist as an additional optional plugin. The existing Network Tools, where applicable, are used for this. To trigger roundabouts, simply join road in a four tile area like a circle.

Several new path, drawing \u0026amp;/or graphical bug fixes added. These fixes relate to original Maxis items \u0026amp; also custom content items. Please note: It may require rebuilding some sections of network \u0026amp;/or also the game given several game months, if not a lot longer (i.e. 2 years depending on city size, pc specs etc), in order for some of these fixes to take affect. Most internal files have now been compressed to help reduce the overall file size of the NAM. This should not affect functionality. Main NAM.dat surpasses 10,000 files mark. Version 17 (17 June 2005) # Main mod file by default, no longer contains Avenue Tuning Lanes (ATL). This portion of the mod exists as an optional component by way of an additional Plugin file. Please see the Installation Instructions regarding this optional plugin file. Numerous visual improvements made to various existing items. 70 plus new junctions \u0026amp;/or intersection types added. These new junctions typically involve \u0026ldquo;Network1 Piece or JunctionType, Network2 Overhead (or underneath ~ relative to Network1)\u0026rdquo;. As some examples; Orthogonal Street + Junction, Diagonal ElevatedRail. Also; Orthogonal Rail + Junction, Diagonal ElevatedHighway. And; Orthogonal ElevatedRail + Junction, Diagonal Avenue. And many others similar to these involving all the different (above ground) networks. If in doubt, please experiment. Version 16 (8 June 2005) # Ground Light Rail (GLR) Mod (Alpha 3) has been merged \u0026amp; included with the NAM. Currently at this time this inclusion only extends to Puzzle Piece related items. Please see the Contents for more details. Avenue Turning Lane (ATL) Mod (beta_04) has been merged \u0026amp; included with the NAM. Left-Hand Version players please see Installation Instructions for additional Plugin(s) required. Left Hand Version Rail-Networks Fix: A fix has been made, for players who actively use Left Hand Version of the game, for all of the Rail-Based networks. This fix encompasses Rail, ElevatedRail, MonoRail, \u0026amp; Subway networks \u0026amp; any intersections involving these networks. This fix makes adjustments so that the Trains on these networks operate \u0026amp; run on their proper side for Left-Hand Version players, just like cars do on road based networks. This fix is also UDI compliant (where applicable). This fix is only applicable \u0026amp; only intended for active Left-Hand Version players. This fix subsequently has a bearing on Transit Enabled Lots. Left-Hand Version players please see the Installation Instructions for additional Plugin(s) required. For more details regarding this fix please read the Technical Notes. Numerous visual improvements made to various existing items ~ of which there is to many to list. OneWayRoad Bridges have been adjusted. The models \u0026amp; textures they use are no longer dependent on the games own files, \u0026amp; hence can be changed. Please see the Contents for more details. Monorail over Elevated Highway overpass. Double Diagonal Rail x Orthogonal Avenue (this is a normal ground intersection). Numerous new Puzzle Pieces added. Any new Puzzle Pieces have been placed in their appropriate menu button. A majority of new Puzzle Piece items have been integrated into their existing appropriate Puzzle Pieces menu position \u0026amp; can be accessed via the Home/End keyboard key. For example; the Diagonal Road Start/End Puzzle Piece is integrated along with the existing Orthogonal Road Start/End Puzzle Piece. Using the Home/End keyboard keys will rotate the item from orthogonal to diagonal to orthogonal etc. The same applies to many other Puzzle Pieces containing a Diagonal component. Please see the Contents for more details. OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces have been overhauled to address Pathing/Automata issues that currently exist with them. Most OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces now contain Directional Enforcing \u0026amp; contain Directional Arrows to assist with their placement \u0026amp; general use. Please note: For this reason any existing OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces should be checked, preferably bulldozed \u0026amp; replaced, especially if Pathing issues start to arise. The game should also be given some time to adjust \u0026amp; update because of this. This adjustment will ultimately reduce the Pathing/Automata issues that currently exist with this item \u0026amp; make them function more efficiently. Using either query tools \u0026amp;/or the bulldozing tool \u0026amp; highlighting OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces (one tile at a time only) will show these Directional Arrows, \u0026amp; hence the flow of direction. The above paragraph subsequently also applies to OneWayRoad Overpasses. The existing 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Piece has been overhauled to address pathing/automata issue that currently exist with the item \u0026amp; now contain Directional Enforcing. Please note: For this reason any existing 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Pieces should be checked, preferably bulldozed \u0026amp; replaced, especially if Pathing issues start to arise. The game should also be given some time to adjust \u0026amp; update because of this. This adjustment will ultimately reduce the Pathing/Automata issues that currently exist with this item. Directional Arrows have now also been added to applicable 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Pieces \u0026amp; preview models to assist with their placement \u0026amp; general use. Using either query tools \u0026amp;/or the bulldozing tool \u0026amp; highlighting applicable 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Pieces (one tile at a time only) will show these Directional Arrows, \u0026amp; hence the flow of direction. Various other file item adjustments, improvements \u0026amp;/or fixes ~ of which there is to many to list. Main NAM.dat surpasses 8,000 files. Version 15 (8 March 2005) # Orthogonal Elevated Highway over Orthogonal Ground Highway Stack. Note; if you\u0026rsquo;ve used a previous (file) version of this in-game, for best usage be sure to bulldoze the item \u0026amp; re-build it. Diagonal Avenue transition into Orthogonal Road. To join, simply drag a straight road into a dead-end diagonal avenue. Orthogonal Road transition into Double Diagonal OneWayRoad – this must be joined using the Road tool, in a similar fashion as the Diagonal Avenue to Orthogonal Road transition above. Be sure when/if connecting this, that the Double Diagonal OneWayRoads\u0026rsquo; flow of traffic matches up with the road it\u0026rsquo;s transitioning into. Elevated Highway transition into Double OneWayRoad – Orthogonal \u0026amp; Diagonal. The Elevated Highway tool must be used to join the two networks, in the same fashion as ElevatedHighway\u0026lt;\u0026gt;Avenue transition; in order to join, the OneWayRoad section of network must be two tiles width. Fixed a pathing issue with games original Diagonal Elevated Highway over Orthogonal Elevated Highway overpass, which prevented vehicles from using the whole of one side of the diagonal highway overpass. New Orthogonal Elevated Highway (Raised) over Diagonal Elevated Highway (Flat) Overpass. The Orthogonal portion of the Elevated Highway rises over the Diagonal portion of the Elevated Highway. This is in addition to the games original overpass of this type, which has the Diagonal portion rising over the Orthogonal portion. If the conditions are right, this will be built automatically when using the Elevated Highway Tool. New Orthogonal Ground Highway (Raised) over Diagonal Ground Highway (Flat) Overpass. The Orthogonal portion of the Ground Highway rises over the Diagonal portion of the Ground Highway. This is in addition to the games original overpass of this type, which has the Diagonal portion rising over the Orthogonal portion. If the conditions are right, this will be built automatically when using the Ground Highway Tool. Minor fix of issues resulting from custom content (seems some particular custom related Overpasses have been unable to draw/build – this should now be fixed though). Double Diagonal Rail Merge, as well as new intersections related to this. It should now also be easier to draw/drag Double Diagonal Rail. Please note; that while numerous bugs related to this have been addressed, some may still exist. (Single) Orthogonal Rail x Double Diagonal Rail intersection, as well as new intersections related to this. Please note; that while numerous bugs related to the implementation of this have been addressed, some may still exist. A number of (other) Rail related (drawing) bugs \u0026amp;/or intersections addressed. Please note; that it may require bulldozing \u0026amp;/or (re-)drawing some sections/intersections of rail network in order for some of these addressed bugs to take effect. All existing Road/OneWayRoad/Avenue Overpasses, Puzzle Pieces, Ground \u0026amp; Elevated Highway Ramps Preview Models have been given a facelift. Following (diagonal-based) Puzzle Pieces added: Orthogonal Road over diagonal/double diagonal Rail Orthogonal Road over diagonal/double diagonal Road Orthogonal Road over diagonal/double diagonal OneWayRoad Orthogonal Road over diagonal Avenue Orthogonal Road over diagonal GroundHighway Orthogonal OneWayRoad over diagonal/double diagonal Rail Orthogonal OneWayRoad over diagonal/double diagonal Road Orthogonal OneWayRoad over diagonal/double diagonal OneWayRoad Orthogonal OneWayRoad over diagonal Avenue Orthogonal OneWayRoad over diagonal GroundHighway Orthogonal Avenue over diagonal/double diagonal Rail Orthogonal Avenue over diagonal/double diagonal Road Orthogonal Avenue over diagonal/double diagonal OneWayRoad Orthogonal Avenue over diagonal Avenue Orthogonal Avenue over diagonal GroundHighway Orthogonal Rail over diagonal/double diagonal Rail Orthogonal Rail over diagonal/double diagonal Road Orthogonal Rail over diagonal/double diagonal OneWayRoad Orthogonal Rail over diagonal Avenue Orthogonal Rail over diagonal GroundHighway Please note: Diagonal-based Puzzle Pieces are more temperamental. Extra care should be taken when interacting with these (placement, bulldozing etc.) Version 14 (29 November 2004) # All Ped Mall Tiles \u0026amp; Footbridges now contain YIMBY Effects. Specific details of the (YIMBY) Effects are as follows: Type of Effect (Magnitude, Radius) Landmark Effect (150,7) Park Effect (150,7) Mayor Rating Effect (5,8) Air Pollution Reduction (-150,3) Water Pollution Reduction (-100,3) Garbage Reduction (-10,0) Version 13 (15 November 2004) # ElevatedHighway to GroundHighway Extended Transition (This is actually an Interchange item). Missing Paths fixed for the Avenue Y-Stack, causing a delayed reaction/freezing with the game when placed. Avenue curve missing Pedestrian Path files fixed; this prevented Sims from being able to walk along an Avenue Curve, \u0026amp; potentially preventing them from accessing Mass Transit buildings along Diagonal Avenue. Lights added to Elevated Rail Dual/Double-Decker Networking Pieces. Diagonal Avenue to Diagonal Road transition. The Avenue tool \u0026amp;/or Road tool can be used to connect the two on the diagonal. Orthogonal OneWayRoad to Orthogonal Road transition. Diagonal OneWayRoad to Diagonal Road transition. Improvements made to Double-Diagonal OneWayRoad to Diagonal Avenue Transition \u0026amp; Double-Diagonal OneWayRoad to Diagonal GroundHighway Transition. The OneWayRoad tool itself can now be used as well, to join to Diagonal Avenue/GroundHighway. Various GroundHighway, ElevatedHighway, \u0026amp; Avenue; intersections \u0026amp;/or tiles; fixes \u0026amp;/or improvements, \u0026amp; are as follows; GroundHighways \u0026amp; ElevatedHighways can now be shifted over sidewards by just one tile in a single continuous stretch, thus removing the previous two tile restriction. This is applicable to both Orthogonal \u0026amp; Diagonal directions (try a little experimenting). Models, Textures, \u0026amp;/or Paths addressed as applicable for the following items (References to \u0026ldquo;S-Curve\u0026rdquo; can \u0026amp; do encompass a sideward shift of the network mentioned by one tile \u0026amp;/or two tiles, as applicable); PLEASE NOTE; that some of these may still have some minor issues with them.

See the Traffic Plugin \u0026amp;/or Automata Plugin files for full details. Ground Highway to One way road transitions added. Version 1 (24 April 2004) # NetworkAddonMod Beta Version released. Please consult this file in conjunction with the Contents file for a list of Transit related items added for this mod to date. Pre-NAM Features (2003-2004, incorporated in NAM Version 1) # Textures changed for Street to Avenue intersections for better visual look. Made it possible to have double-wide diagonal rail transition into double wide orthogonal rail and vice-versa Created a work-around for a bug that prevented one-way roads from intersecting at a road-avenue t-intersection. In order to build this intersection, draw the one-way road last and draw it only to/from the tile next to the road/avenue intersection Made street intersections with road/avenue t-intersections easier. Draw the street last and draw it only to/from the tile next to the road/avenue intersection Made it possible for a orth 1-way road to intersect with a diag road/ave t-intersection Made it possible for a diag 1-way road to intersect with a orth road/ave t-intersection Fixed a visual bug that caused traffic to drive on the wrong side of the road on a diag ave-diag ave T-intersection. Fixed a bug that prevented U-turns on diagonal avenues that intersected or T-intersected with a diagonal road. Fixed a bug that prevented U-turns on orthagonal avenues that intersected with a diagonal avenue. Fixed a U-Drive-It bug for a ground rail intersection that previously did not allow you to switch the track while driving a train in U-Drive-It. On Avenue intersections between a straight (orthogonal) avenue and a diagonal avenue, Sims coming from the diagonal avenue could not turn left onto the straight avenue. This is fixed. The ability to dead end straight (orthogonal) roads or oneways into a diagonal avenue has been added. Thanks to Teirusu for the textures. Enjoy! Diagonal T interchanges have improved graphics. Sims could not drive straight through the road in a parallel road onramp to a ground highway when driving so the highway is on their right. This is fixed. One of the bugs causing cars to jump to different ramps on diagonal T ground highway interchanges was fixed. Avenue/oneway transitions now have custom graphics so they look better, textures compliments of Teirusu. When entering a ferry terminal in U-Drive it, your mission could fail instead of being redirected back onto the road. This is fixed, thanks to Karybdis. When driving over a ground level highway on an avenue overpass with onramps in the left lane, a U-Drive-it mission would fail. This is fixed. U turns immediately bordering avenue onramps on an avenue crossing a ground level highway could not be used by people just leaving or about to enter the highway. This is fixed. U turns immediately bordering avenue onramps on an avenue crossing an elevated highway could not be used by people just leaving or about to enter the highway. This is fixed. Half of the time Sims went underneath a diagonal elevated highway on a road with onramps, they could not turn left on the onramp. This has been fixed in Rush Hour. Half of the time Sims exited a diagonal elevated highway onto a diagonal road with offramps, they could not turn left on the road. This has been fixed in Rush Hour. Added the ability to end diagonal Oneways in a T-intersection with a perpendicular diagonal avenue. When Sims approached a diagonal avenue from a diagonal oneway, they could not turn left on the avenue. This is fixed. When Sims were driving on a diagonal avenue, they could not make a U-turn at half of the intersections with a perpendicular oneway road. This is fixed. Added the ability to end diagonal roads in a T-intersection with a perpendicular diagonal avenue. Fixed another avenue/oneway transition bug. It should be out of beta now, and fully operational with no further issues. Fixed avenue/oneway transitions so that U-Drive-it works in both lanes. Transitioning avenues to one way roads without an intersection. Previously, cars could not make some left turns onto a diagonal road when approaching from a straight one way road. This is now fixed. In three way monorail junctions, you could not change the switch\u0026rsquo;s direction. Driving the monorail over the switch would end your U-Drive-It mission instantly. This has been fixed. 3 Bugs fixed which prohibited cars from turning in various directions when a diagonal road crossed a straight avenue. Avenues dead ending into streets were completely impassable by any form of transit. Perpendicular road to one way intersections oriented on the diagonal did not allow left turns from the one way. The rest of the perpendicular road to road intersections oriented on the diagonal were fixed. Sims could not turn left from one of the roads coming from either direction. Updated some intersections between avenues and one way roads to show better automata. Diagonal Avenues with grid aligned (non-diagonal) ground train tracks crossing the avenue would not allow any cars to pass. A road to road diagonal T intersection was not allowing Sims to turn left onto one of the roads. Continuing an avenue with one way streets from an avenue/one way intersection did not allow any cars to pass through the avenue/one way intersection. Sims could not turn left at some diagonal avenues when approaching from a diagonal road. Elevated rail lines crossing ground highways prevented cars from travelling on the ground highway below. North or Southbound one way roads could not create T intersections with Westward avenues. Some intersections between avenues and one way roads did not allow correct turns. Avenues dead ending into one way roads did not allow any Sims to pass through the intersection. On half of the perpendicular road to road intersections oriented on the diagonal, Sims could not turn left from one of the roads coming from either direction. "}),e.add({id:7,href:"/docs/reference/technical-information/",title:"Technical Information",description:"Important information for NAM installations.",content:`Note that this document is still in the process of transitioning to the new format introduced in NAM 36, and may contain some outdated information. While it is mainly intended for persons with the skills to open the NAM\u0026rsquo;s associated file(s), it contains important information about the game. Therefore the following information aims at the more technical side of things and should only be considered as an additional source of information about the mods\u0026rsquo; files \u0026amp;/or game. To install the mod, please refer to the Installation Instructions.
1. Known (Game) Issue(s) \u0026amp;/or Bugs # This section explains currently known game issues with SimCity 4\u0026rsquo;s Traffic/Network system that may be relevant to this mod. This is not all inclusive, \u0026amp; as such other issues may currently exist that are not covered here.
1.1 General # Because we do not have the same level of tools \u0026amp;/or degree of control over the game that Maxis does, some custom-based items may currently have Pathing, Graphical \u0026amp;/or other unknown/known issues with them, \u0026amp; exhibit behaviour that may not \u0026amp;/or should not occur normally. Unfortunately, some issues are beyond our control \u0026amp; as such may not be fixable at all. The following sections explains some of these issues in more detail
1.2 Networks # SimCity 4\u0026rsquo;s Networks, in general, exhibit a proximity behaviour when actively using the bulldozing tool \u0026amp;/or the different Networking Tools (Street, Road, Avenue, Rail, etc). When actively using these tools to bulldoze \u0026amp;/or draw a section of network, intersection tile \u0026amp;/or otherwise, this proximity behaviour can sometimes invoke issues, drawing bugs \u0026amp;/or otherwise in certain circumstances that may not otherwise occur normally. Such issues may also prevent the drawing of an intersection \u0026amp;/or section of network that might otherwise be possible to draw. This proximity behaviour is generally 3 to 4 tiles, but may be higher or lower in some cases.
Solution
While this proximity behaviour may be overcome in some cases by implementing the necessary rules for the game for such issues, the time it would take outweighs the benefits of implementing such rules in most cases (though some rules have been implemented for some of these). Often times, some issues may be rectified by bulldozing \u0026amp;/or re-drawing a section of network, intersection tile \u0026amp;/or otherwise, making sure the same action, series of actions, or set-up, that invoked the issue in the first place is not repeated.
1.3 Paths # SimCity 4\u0026rsquo;s Pathing system, in general, is controlled by a set of rules. For each tile of network that exists in the game, there is a Path file, \u0026amp; Paths (or Plotting Points) within that file, for the in-game tile. Unfortunately, some aspects of SimCity 4\u0026rsquo;s Pathing system are controlled by the games engine (or EXE). Because of this, some custom-based items may currently have UDI/Pathing issues with them, \u0026amp; exhibit commuter \u0026amp;/or UDI behaviour that may not \u0026amp;/or should not occur normally. Some Custom-Based Interchanges \u0026amp; Rail-Based networks, at least, are known to be affected by this to some degree.
1.4 Interchange-Base Related Items - Placement - # There are two known critical bugs that exist with the game that are related to Interchange-Base RelatedItems, \u0026amp; the placement of these items. The following section explains these two bugs.
1.4.1 Placement \u0026amp; Zones # A bug exists that can potentially prevent the removal of a zones\u0026rsquo; Building/Lot. This same bug also has the potential to cause the game to crash. The exact precise cause of the issue is not known. The following outlines the general-case scenario in which these issues may arise \u0026amp; possible solution:
Items related to known issue:
Zones of any type (excluding Landfill) \u0026amp; the associated Buildings/Lots that spur from \u0026amp;/or sit on these zones. This can include residential, commercial, industrial zones, of all density levels, \u0026amp; their related Buildings \u0026amp;/or Lots. These related Buildings/Lots can include both Maxis originals \u0026amp; any custom made Buildings/Lots related to zones. Interchange Related Item(s) (IRI); this can include both Maxis originals \u0026amp; any custom made items that are interchange-base related, such as; Highway Overpasses; Ramps; Cloverleafs; PuzzlePieces; \u0026amp; other similar item(s). Route Query Tool \u0026amp;/or Normal Query Tool (in the case of the game crashing). Point of Issue Arising \u0026amp;/or Crashing:
If an IRI is built on already existing zones\u0026rsquo; Buildings/Lots, the removal of these buildings where the IRI is \u0026amp;/or was built may potentially no longer be possible to properly remove. Using either the Route Query Tool \u0026amp;/or Normal Query Tool on these affected Buildings/Lots, including even just hovering the Query Tool over any affected Lots, may also potentially cause the game to instantly crash to the desktop.
Solution:
In order for this bug not to be triggered in the first place, it is highly advisable that when placing an IRI that the terrain below the item be clear, \u0026amp; not contain any zones, \u0026amp;/or related buildings.
If by some reason the bug has been triggered, i.e. an IRI has been built on some zones, then be sure not to use either Query Tools on \u0026amp;/or over any of the zones\u0026rsquo; Buildings/Lots otherwise the game may instantly crash. In order to remove any buildings (that have been affected) that can not immediately be bulldozed/removed properly; re-zone the affected area, making sure there is still normal road access. Wait for a period of several (game) months, \u0026amp; then attempt to remove the affected Buildings/Lots. This may potentially enable the affected buildings/lots to be properly removed.
1.4.2 Placement \u0026amp; Transit Enabled Lots # An issue with the game which may cause the game to crashhas been identified. At this time the exact precise cause of the issue is yet to be determined. The following outlines the general-case scenario in which the issue may cause the game to crash:
Items related to known issue:
Transit Enabled Lot(s) (TEL); this can include both Maxis originals \u0026amp; any custom made TEL. Interchange Related Item(s) (IRI); this can include both Maxis originals \u0026amp; any custom made items that are interchange-base related, such as; Highway Overpasses; Ramps; Cloverleafs; PuzzlePieces; \u0026amp; other similar item(s). Cursor of Interchange-base Related Item(s). Point of Crashing:
If the Cursor contains an IRI on it \u0026amp; then this Cursor is hovered over \u0026amp;/or clicked on (\u0026amp;/or repeated) a TEL, it can in some circumstantial cases cause the game to instantly crash to the desktop. Currently this is only known to occur if the IRIs\u0026rsquo; network on the Cursor is the same network with which the TEL is compatible with.
Solution:
Currently at this time, a full-proof work-around to the issue is not yet known. It is simply advised that users avoid moving the Cursor over a TEL if the Cursor has an IRI on it to minimize the chances of the game crashing. It is also advised that any TEL that exists in a city has its compatible network drawn right into/through the Lot, as this will also minimize the chances of the game crashing.
For more information on the above issue, see the following thread:Cursor + Transit Enabled Lot = Crashing.
The issue described above has been looked into, \u0026amp; currently at this time evidence seems to point to the problem existing within the games\u0026rsquo; executable itself, therefore there is nothing that can (currently) be done about this to completely \u0026amp; properly rid of the bug (unless Maxis decides to address the issue). The reason the issue has been mentioned here is because it has a probable significant impact on the use of this mod \u0026amp; those that use it.
2. Files used # 2.1 Existing files used indirectly in association with the Network Addon Mod # The Network Addon Mod currently relies on a number of the games existing files that you will already have.
These files include, but are not limited to, the following:
Various FSH files. Also known as Texture files. Various Exemplar files. Various S3D files. Also known as 3D files or Models. Various SC4Path files. Various Text based files. UI or User-Interface Files LUA Files. Also known as script files. Quite a number of the above files are also included in the Network Addon Mod and form part of Transit related Bugfixes \u0026amp;/or other Additional features.
If you\u0026rsquo;ve changed the look and/or contents of any of these above files, \u0026amp;/or used a mod or Bat/Lot file that has, there is a big chance that any/all of the features of this Mod will be affected. The extent of this is not something that can be told, it all really depends on what, if anything, may have been done to any of the above file types that are connected with the look \u0026amp;/or functionality of the contents of the Network Addon Mod.
2.2 Unique files used directly within the Network Addon Mod # The Network Addon Mod includes, depends on, and uses a number of files that are unique to games\u0026rsquo; engine. Because of this, certain files can not be replicated, changed, removed, \u0026amp;/or modified without any change, consequences \u0026amp;/or adverse affects on the game. These files include, but are not limited to, the following specific files [with Instance IDs]:
Cohort File(s)
ElTrain Cohort - 0x8BBF6D45 Exemplar File(s)
Traffic Simulator - 0xC9133286 Automata Tuning - 0x00000001 DirtRoad - 0x0000001A Dirt Road Placement Tuning Parameters - 0xEBE08CDA Traffic Commute Graph - 0x0000000B [This file is included with \u0026quot; _\u0026hellip;10xCommute\u0026quot; files] RUL File(s)

Network Parameters - 0x8A5993B9 3. Path(s) (files) # 3.1 Puzzle Pieces \u0026amp; Overpasses # Because the game has Left-hand \u0026amp; Right-hand driving versions, covering all the different Pathing possibilities involved in relation to OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces, in an efficient \u0026amp; effective manner, sometimes makes them somewhat problematic to code/path for. For this reason some OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces, namely Intersection-Based related Puzzle Pieces, contain Bi-Directional Pathing for both forward and reverse Pathing files, or Right-hand \u0026amp; Left-hand drive. The same also applies to some Road \u0026amp; Avenue Intersection-Based Puzzle Pieces. This was done as a preventative measure to overcome any complication issues that may have arisen with players using the items of this mod that are associated with, namely OneWayRoad, Puzzle Pieces, with having any functional \u0026amp;/or just general problems with them. As a result players may notice some pathing \u0026amp;/or automata oddities \u0026amp;/or issues with/when using these particular items of the mod.
The above paragraph typically does not apply to Puzzle Pieces or Overpasses that contain Directional Arrows. Puzzle Pieces \u0026amp; Overpasses that contain Directional Arrowsshould function properly as they should, typically without any Pathing/Automata oddities, as long as they are placed \u0026amp; linked up properly according to their Directional Arrows.
3.2 U-Drive-It \u0026amp;/for EI Rail # There exists some game limitations with which we had to work with in order to make UDI for EI Rail possible. Unfortunately, for certain aspects of UDI for a Rail-based network, the game will only recognise certain paths for the track switches (Track switches are what make it possible to go in different directions at junctions during UDI). Because of this, UDI EI Rail \u0026amp;/or EI Rail Path files contains a replicated set of paths; one set of paths for its own original intended network; \u0026amp; one set for the UDI EI Rail mode. The set of paths for UDI EI Rail mode are technically ground-rail-based pathing. Because of this, it should be possible to take a UDI passenger train \u0026amp;/or UDI freight train from ground rail to EI Rail using a Transit Enabled Lot (\u0026amp; visa-versa for EI Rail Train to ground rail). The Transit Enabled Lot would have to contain special custom path files though, in order to achieve this. This however, is currently outside the scope of this mod. |
4. Network Hierarchy # There exists a hierarchy in the game with the different Networks. The following is a guideline on the hierarchy of the different above ground Network types:
[In order of Top of the hierarchy to the bottom of the hierarchy]
Monorail Network Elevated Rail Network Highway Network Rail Network GroundHighway Network Avenue Network OneWayRoad Network Road Network Street Network ANT Network (RHW Network) The higher up the hierarchy a network is, a higher priority is given to the network when drawing one network over another (in a parallel overlapping fashion). For this reason it is not possible to drag a network at the lower end of the hierarchy over a network that is higher up the hierarchy, \u0026amp; for the network to be converted to that of the lower hierarchical network. This is something defined in the games engine and it is highly doubtful that it can be changed. Apart from this though, generally this hierarchy should not cause any problems, unless you are a modder trying to mod Networks(s) \u0026amp;/or associated files.
5. Lots # This mod does not contain Lots \u0026amp;/or Lot [Exemplar] files at all, such as those found in Buildings Lots; in any way what so ever.
6. ANT Item # The ANT item that Maxis left incomplete/inactive in the game, with the technical name of \u0026ldquo;DirtRoad\u0026rdquo;, was an optional plugin that has been superseeded by the Rural Highway Mod (RHW). The complete functionality of the ANT Plugin has been transferred to the RHW and is not longer supported by the NAM. For more information about the RHW, please refer to the RHW readme file.
7. NAM ID Conventions # This section briefly covers the file conventions that the NAM typically follows for its custom content (where applicable). These conventions are guidelines only \u0026amp; as such some pre-existing items pre-date when these guidelines were established \u0026amp; may not follow the conventions. Also; some limited exceptions \u0026amp;/or variations may apply or (need to) exist due to functional, technical \u0026amp;/or internal housekeeping purposes.
Most conventions are governed by or have been influenced by Maxis conventions. These conventions mostly apply to Network related files, \u0026amp; while it is not completely comprehensive, it does cover InstanceID conventions, Network conventions, \u0026amp;/or any other conventions that may be applicable or appropriate for this section at this time. These conventions encompass S3D Model files, SC4Path files, Network-Based Exemplar files, Network-Based FSH files, Network-Based EffectDir files, Network-Based Prop related files, \u0026amp; possibly others.
GroupID designations: GroupIDs of the various items \u0026amp;/or areas of the game are typically used as flags for functional purposes \u0026amp; are usually governed by Maxis file formats. InstanceID designations for Interchange base items: 0x5NDDD##Z InstanceID designations for Non-Interchange base items. 0x5FNDDDWZ InstanceID designations for Bridges \u0026amp; Network Props (like custom Traffic Lights): 0x5NDDDZR0 N = Network designation. See table below for these. DDD = MonthMonthDayDay in full extended decimal form (with all leading zeros) converted into hex. Where 2004 is the baseyear \u0026amp; each subsequent year 12+ Month per year should be added to MonthMonth before converting to hex. For multiple items on a set date, increase/decrease accordingly based on the initial date. # = remaining portion of hex making up the whole InstanceID. This portion of the InstanceID typically based on the base InstanceID of the item. W= Wealth. This typically only applies to referenced S3D files \u0026amp; FSH files (where applicable). Z = Zoom level. This typically only applies to referenced S3D files \u0026amp; FSH files (where applicable). R = Rotation. This typically only applies to referenced S3D files \u0026amp; FSH files (where applicable).

Left Hand Version Rail Networks Fix # This section is an extension from the above section that deals with NAM ID Conventions. The conventions in this section however only apply to SC4Path files.
This section deals with the \u0026lsquo;Left-Hand Version Rail Networks fix\u0026rsquo; included in the Network Addon Mod.
Right-Hand Drive Version versus Left-Hand Drive Version; SimCity 4 path files were written with Right-Hand Drive players in mind. Nearly all Path fileswere written with Right-Hand drive as the default. This applies to road-based networks such as street, road, avenue, \u0026amp; rail-based networks such as rail, monorail \u0026amp; elevated rail. For Left-Hand Drive versions, the game automatically reverses all road based pathing (or \u0026ldquo;Car\u0026rdquo; pathing), with the exception of onewayroads. The game does not however, apply this same automatic reversal for rail-based networks; and this is why this fix has, in part, been created.
This fix makes use of the games INI Network file that enables manual reversing of path files specifically for Left Hand Versions through the use of special InstanceID masking \u0026amp; path file replacement, upon which the exe automatically scans at runtime. Unfortunately, current tests show that the Subway network is an exception to this. For this reason these paths have been included in an additional Plugin for Left-Hand versions. This extra additional Plugin also contains other files for Left-Hand versions. This extra dat Plugin should only be used for Left Hand drive versions. See the Installation Instructionsregarding the installation of this extra Plugin file.
This particular fix will impact on Left-Hand Drive Versions. Because of the necessary adjustments that have been made, this fix will subsequently impact on Transit Enabled Lots, for Left Hand Versions. The following explains this impact in more detail.
Transit Enabled Lots
Transit Enabled Lots that do not specify an actual Path file \u0026amp;/or just use simple RUL Flags in its LotConFig property, then it should not be affected \u0026amp; no change should need to be made. However, Transit Enabled Lots that actually specify path file(s) in any of their LotConFig Properties will most likely be affected \u0026amp; may need modifying. Transit Enabled Lots of this type will typically have 0x00000007 type LotConFig properties (or in other words; 0x00000007 as the first value), \u0026amp; have 16+ values for the LotConFig property, specifying actual path files (i.e. InstanceID) in the 16th+ value. To overcome any adverse affects this fix may cause, for Transit Enabled Lots for Left Hand Versions, please read the following very carefully;
Transit Enabled Lots specifying Path files will already have the necessary path file(s) for Right Hand versions. For Left Hand Versions though, the path file(s) may need to be replicated, IIDs changed, \u0026amp; the Rail-RelatedPathing reversed for Left Hand versions (\u0026amp; only rail-related pathing. Car-based pathing should not be reversed. There may exist some very limited exceptions to this). So in essence there will be two sets of Path files; one for Right Hand versions \u0026amp; one for Left Hand versions. Both the Right-Hand Version Path file(s) InstanceID \u0026amp; Left Hand Version Path file(s) InstanceID then need to be in a particular InstanceID range(s), in order to work properly for both Right Hand \u0026amp; Left Hand players. The following ranges are valid Path File Instance ID conversion ranges in which the game will automatically use the replacement Path files in the case of Left Hand Drive Versions;
(Other IID reversal ranges exist, but the following ones are the main ones. Please see the INI file itself for a raw \u0026amp; thorough breakdown).
Short abbreviated version
0x0N###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x4N###### 0x5N###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x7N###### 0x5FN##### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x7FN##### Where \u0026lsquo;N\u0026rsquo; = Network designation.
Long version (actual specific IID ranges)
Default Path File(s) \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Replacement Path File(s) Right-Hand Version \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Left-Hand Version 0x03###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x43###### 0x53###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x73###### 0x5F3##### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x7F3##### 0x08###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x48###### 0x58###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x78###### 0x5F8##### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x7F8##### 0x0D###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x4D###### 0x5D###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x7D###### 0x5FD##### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x7FD##### 0xEA###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x4A###### # = remaining hex of the InstanceID of the Path file(s). This portion of the Instance ID should be exactly the same for both Right-Hand \u0026amp; Left-Hand versions. As some examples:
0x 0 3031500 \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x 4 3031500 ~ these are actual path files found in the NAM \u0026amp;/or the games own files 0x 5F8 32900 \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x 7F8 32900 ~ these are actual path files found in the NAM 0x 5D 123900 \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x 7D 123900 ~ in the case of a Rail-based Bridge All Rail-Related IID Ranges are covered \u0026amp; reversed for Left Hand Drive versions. Any Path file(s) that fall within the ranges listed above, regardless of the type of Paths it contains, will be scanned by the exe, replacement Path File(s) used \u0026amp; then reversed (NOTE: If a replacement Path file does not exist, the tile in question may not function). Since the exe does not actually reverse rail-based networks, it will simply use the Replacement Path file(s) as is for Left Hand Versions. If there exists car pathing in the replacement file(s) though, then the exe will only reverse the car pathing portion of the path file for Left Hand Drive versions. |
9. End Notes # A.1 # Commute Graph Exemplar: This has only been included in files with the \u0026quot; _\u0026hellip;10xCommute\u0026quot; in its name. The only reason for this is to try and off-set the Commute Graph display so as to give a more representable idea of the commute time being experienced [against/compared to what people might usually consider/expect]. It\u0026rsquo;s highly advisable that any time you change which Traffic Plugin file is used, that you give the game ample time to update everything/anything related \u0026amp;/or connected to the Paths/Commutes. Twelve months game time, at least, should be given. This time will vary though depending on city size, game options, \u0026amp;/or computer system.
A.2 # Please note that some files have been replicated, used, \u0026amp;/or referenced multiply times by different items \u0026amp;/or areas of the files, including referencing the games own original files. One such example of this is some of the Puzzle Pieces; which basically makes use of the overpasses files [not necessarily all of them though].
A.3 # It is highly advisable that you do not change the contents of these files, nor change any of the files TGI, not unless you know very well what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. Since modifying any of these files may cause the file(s) \u0026amp;/or fixes/features of the Network Addon Mod \u0026amp;/or other items not to function properly, not at all, \u0026amp;/or not as intended.

IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU ONLY USE ONE OF THE \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;Automata_Plugin\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; FILES, \u0026amp; ONE ONLY. The NAM Installer should ensure this.
The information below explains which \u0026quot; \u0026hellip;Automata_Plugin\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; files contain what changes. See the notes at the end before using any file.
The \u0026quot; \u0026hellip;Automata_Plugin\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; files have a naming scheme according to the following below:
\u0026quot; _\u0026hellip;Standard\u0026quot; = Default Maxis values, except: It has been slightly modified to take into account the RealHighway network\u0026rsquo;s speed. It has been changed to give more of an accurate representation of the speed the vehicles are travelling at on the RealHighway network, compared to the other networks. Nothing else in this file is changed.
\u0026quot; \u0026hellip;Automata24\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; = Automata, of most kinds, is displayed for most of the 24-Hour Sim day.
\u0026quot; \u0026hellip;Radical\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; = The following changes [increases/decreases]:
Vehicle Lifespan Range: Min:50, Max:380 Ped Lifespan Range: Min:128, Max:255 Sim Prop Anim range: Min:25, Max:150 Max Peds per second [per tile]:100 Max Vehicles per second [per tile]:250 Max Peds [at any one time]:2500 Max Vehicles [at any one time]:5000 Max Aircraft [at any one time]:35 Max Watercraft [at any one time]:100 Sims per Train Car:100 Sims per Bus:80 Commute Train Length: Min:5, Max:15 Freight Train Length: Min:9, Max:25 Maximum level of Freight Trucks Cut-off [Industrial City Jobs]:500,000 Curve speed multiplier:0.7 [of normal speed] Population Occupant Trip Radius [in tiles]:10 Moving Van Frequency [new residence]:2 Hill/Slope speed multiplier [% of normal speed when going up/down a hill]: 0.20 Simulation Speed multiplier-For Cheetah Speed only [this only applies if you use \u0026ldquo;Variable Speed Automata\u0026rdquo; in the Games Options]:8 Spawn/Recall for:
Streets: 40%/30%,10%/40% Roads: 50%/30%,10%/40% Avenues: 60%/30%,10%/40% Highways: 85%/60%,10%/30% \u0026ndash;Add Information about Persistent options here\u0026ndash;
Note: Spawn/Recall is the percent chance/capacity at which more automata are added/removed for/from a tile. First set of numbers represents the percent chance at the specified capacity at which automata will be added; the second set is the percent chance at the specified capacity at which automata will be removed.
Additional Notes # The file names explain what files contain what changes \u0026amp; are all based on the \u0026quot; _\u0026hellip;Standard\u0026quot; file above. If a file name contains two [or more] of the above names, then that means it contains those changes as detailed above.
You do not actually need/have to use any of the \u0026quot; \u0026hellip;Automata_Plugin\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; file if you do not want to. It is not really imperative to the Network Addon Mod that a \u0026quot; \u0026hellip;Automata_Plugin\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; file is used. If you choose not to use one of the \u0026quot; \u0026hellip;Automata_Plugin\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; files though, then the Automata on the RealHighway network will not be represented fairly/accurately as intended.
Automata: Automata are basically animations; a \u0026ldquo;visual\u0026rdquo; representation. So while they represent the underlying Traffic happening [to some degree only really], they are only animations, and as such any of the changes made above do not actually change any functional aspects of networks capacities/speeds/commutes. Automata, being generated as a representation of statistical data, also may be prone to bizarre behavior that would defy real-world traffic logic. Due to the nature of how they are programmed, this is not something the NAM Team can address.
`}),e.add({id:13,href:"/docs/feature-guides/base-network/",title:"Base Network Additions",description:"This file is a general outline to the contents that the Network Addon Mod has, and is intended for anyone and everyone to read.",content:` The documentation on this page may be out of date. The contents of this document may reference older, obsolete NAM content. It, however, can still be used as a reference guide. Some additional features, such as the RealHighways (RHW), Network Widening Mod (NWM), RealRailways (RRW), High Speed Rail Project (HSRP), Turn Lanes, and PedMalls are covered in the Feature Guides section of this documentation.
Additional Overpasses # Fully functional Overpasses. The following additional Overpasses are now included with this mod.
Note: Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, all of these Overpasses only exist for the game when following the game\u0026rsquo;s square grid, \u0026amp; not against it.
Road Overpasses # Menu button contains the following overpasses:
Road over Road Road over Rail Road over Street Road over OneWayRoad Road over Avenue OneWayRoad Overpasses # Menu button contains the following overpasses:
Note: OneWayRoad Overpasses now contain Directional Arrows \u0026amp; should be placed accordingly
OneWayRoad over OneWayRoad OneWayRoad over Rail OneWayRoad over Street OneWayRoad over Road OneWayRoad over Avenue OneWayRoad over Ground Highway [this is without ramps] Avenue Overpasses # Menu button contains the following overpasses:
Avenue over Avenue Avenue over Rail Avenue over Street Avenue over Road Avenue over OneWayRoad Other additional overpasses
[Currently, there is no Menu Button for these. If the conditions are right, the game will build these ones automatically when using the applicable network tools to draw them]
Elevated Rail over Elevated Highway Elevated Rail over Monorail Monorail over Elevated Highway Ground Rail over Ground Highway Orthogonal Elevated Highway (Raised) over Diagonal Elevated Highway (Flat) Orthogonal Ground Highway (Raised) over Diagonal Ground Highway (Flat) More overpasses may [or may not] be added with future updates.
To build these Overpasses etc, either select them from the Menu or just simply drag one network type over the other. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see a particular Overpass in the Menu, then use the Network tools to create them. For Example: build a stretch of Monorail track; then using the Elevated Rail Network tool, drag a long-enough stretch of Elevated Rail over the Monorail Network [like: \u0026lsquo;+\u0026rsquo;] and the Elevated Rail over Monorail overpass will build automatically if the conditions are right.
With some of the Overpasses, especially where OneWayRoads are involved, it may be a little difficult sometimes to actually be able to build the overpass. So some patience, trial \u0026amp; error may be needed.
Each of the different Menu Buttons for these overpasses works by using the HOME/END and TAB key(s) on your keyboard. HOME/END rotates the overpasses on the cursor [where possible], and TAB (\u0026amp;/or SHIFT+TAB) cycles through the different overpasses that belongs to that menu button. When you TAB from one overpass to another, the type of overpass is displayed in the TEXT on the cursor itself [where possible].
Overpasses come under the same scope as being Interchange-base Related Item(s).
Additional Interchanges # The following Custom Interchanges are now included with this mod:
Custom Interchange(s) # Includes the following Custom Interchanges:
Ground Highway Trumpet Interchange Ground Highway Partial Y Interchange Ground Highway Y Interchange Orthogonal Elevated Highway by Diagonal Elevated Highway Interchange Elevated Highway over Ground Highway Stack Elevated Highway - 3 Leaf Clover Elevated Highway - 2 Leaf Clover-Adjacent Elevated Highway - 2 Leaf Clover-Opposite Elevated Highway - 1 Leaf Clover Elevated Highway \u0026lt;~\u0026gt; Ground Highway Extended Transition \u0026lsquo;T\u0026rsquo; Highway OnSlope Puzzle Piece Orthogonal/Diagonal Double \u0026lsquo;T\u0026rsquo; Highway OnSlope Puzzle Piece Orthogonal/Diagonal Highway OnSlope Puzzle Piece Orthogonal/Diagonal Ground Highway 45-Curve Elevated Highway 45-Curve Additionally, Elevated Highway over Tram-in-Avenue Orthogonal/Diagonal interchanges can be found at the end of the Perpendicular Ramps button. There currently exist some Path issues with some of these interchanges. Unfortunately, for technical reasons some of these path issues are not possible to fix at all.
Each of the different Custom Interchanges is currently contained in the one Menu Button in the Highway Menu. Use the HOME/END and TAB key(s) on your keyboard. HOME/END rotates the item on the cursor [where possible], and TAB (\u0026amp;/or SHIFT+TAB) cycles through the different items that belongs to that menu button. When you TAB from one item to another, the type is displayed in the TEXT on the cursor itself [where possible].
Interchanges come under the same scope as being Interchange-base Related Item(s).
Additional [Highway] Ramps # The following ramps are now included with this mod:
Note: Unless mentioned otherwise; these ramps only exist for the game when following the game\u0026rsquo;s square grid, \u0026amp; not against it.
Single-Sided Perpendicular Ramps # Menu button contains the following ramps:

The only way to fix this is to use the NAM Left Hand Drive Controller, installed as part of the NAM Left Hand Drive Plugin.
Other Ramps # [Currently, there is no Menu Button for this. If the conditions are right, the game will prompt you for these one(s)]
Elevated Highway Avenue Orthogonal One Sided Dual Ramp [If you have a UK version of the game, or left-hand side driving; then some of these Ramps above will be the opposite. i.e. OnRamp becomes OffRamp. OffRamp becomes OnRamp. Some of the names above have been done intentionally for a reason. They are all different types of Ramps, for now it was just figured the best way to deal with some of them was to name them in this particular manner for easier identifying in-game. This may change though].
Each of the different Menu Buttons for these ramps works by using the HOME/END and TAB key(s) on your keyboard. HOME/END rotates the item on the cursor [where possible], and TAB (\u0026amp;/or SHIFT+TAB) cycles through the different items that belongs to that menu button. When you TAB from one item to another, the type is displayed in the TEXT on the cursor itself [where possible].
Ramps come under the same scope as being Interchange-base Related Item(s).
Puzzle Pieces # The following Puzzle Pieces are now included with this Mod:
Please note: Many Puzzle Piece items now contain a Diagonal component (where applicable) \u0026amp; cover many possible configurations, with either the lower \u0026amp;/or upper portion of the Puzzle Piece.

Note: OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces now contain Directional Arrows (where applicable) \u0026amp; should be placed \u0026amp; linked accordingly in order to work. To view these Directional Arrows after an item has been built, use either query tools \u0026amp;/or the bulldoze tool \u0026amp; hover the tool over applicable OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces (one tile at a time only). Note that not all OneWayRoad Puzzle Piece items contain these Directional Arrows.

This red line indicates that the puzzle piece does also allow creating a Flexible Underpass across the canal.
More puzzle pieces may [or may not] be added with future updates.
Each of the different Menu Buttons for these Puzzle Pieces works by using the HOME/END and TAB key(s) on your keyboard. HOME/END rotates the Puzzle Piece on the cursor [where possible], and TAB (\u0026amp;/or SHIFT+TAB) cycles through the different Puzzle Pieces that belongs to that menu button item. When you TAB from one Puzzle Piece to another, the type of Puzzle Piece is displayed in the TEXT on the cursor itself [where possible]. Puzzle Pieces must be built manually from the Menu.
So what are Puzzle Pieces? # (Please note: That there are some exceptions to the following section. Typical Puzzle Piece placement rules as described \u0026amp; depicted further below do not apply to every single Puzzle Piece item. Some Puzzle Piece based items may differ slightly in their placement \u0026amp;/or use due to their design. The following section is only meant as a guide.)
Puzzle Pieces are essentially like jigsaw puzzles; many smaller pieces making up a bigger picture. Puzzle Pieces came about as a result of Overpasses, from the previous section. With Overpasses you are restricted to having an Overpass at a set length, with the overpass only passing over one network. With using Puzzle Pieces though this set length can be overcome; and you can now build extended Overpasses [extended overpasses must be built manually using the Puzzle Pieces]. You can also have two or more networks, whether they\u0026rsquo;re the same or not, going underneath extended overpass(es); these too must be built manually using the Puzzle Pieces. Puzzle Pieces now also have raised intersections, which should increase their flexibility even more.
Puzzle Pieces can typically be placed on uneven \u0026amp;/or unlevel terrain; including placing Puzzle Pieces next to each other on uneven/unlevel terrain. The more level the terrain is though, the less the Puzzle Piece Model has to conform to the terrain, thus giving a much better visual look. This also includes being able to place Puzzle Pieces on water (any Puzzle Pieces placed on water will still function properly \u0026amp; carry commuters, as long as everything is linked up properly). Note: That this is by design that this is possible.
Intersection-Based Puzzle Pieces: Where there exists Intersection Puzzle Pieces like \u0026ldquo;Road x Road/OneWayRoad\u0026rdquo;, this is an Intersection Puzzle Piece aimed at and primarily for Road + Intersection, but is compatible \u0026amp; will work with OneWayRoad Puzzle Piece connections. Where there exists Intersection Puzzle Pieces like \u0026ldquo;Avenue x Road/OneWayRoad\u0026rdquo;, this is an Intersection Puzzle Piece primarily for Avenue intersection, and is aimed for use with Road \u0026amp;/or OneWayRoad Puzzle Piece connections. In other words, these intersection-based puzzle pieces are flexible. Because of this flexibility though, some minor oddities may occur (please see Technical Notes for more details regarding path oddities).
How To Use Puzzle Pieces? # Most Puzzle Pieces had to be made in a very particular way. For this reason some people may have a little trouble using them sometimes. There is a particular method in which Puzzle Pieces must generally be used, otherwise they may not function properly as intended. Puzzle Pieces that have a dual network, for example Road over Road Puzzle Piece \u0026amp;/or Road over Avenue Puzzle Piece, must typically be placed on top of an existing section of the network in order to implement and use them in the game properly. This is something that may take some practice, a little patience, and some trial and error to do.
Auto-Resolving \u0026amp; how it can help # Because some Puzzle Piece network buttons, especially OneWayRoad Puzzle Piece menu button, contain numerous items on the Home/End keys, trying to find the item you want for a given situation can be impractical. Auto-Resolvinghelps overcome this impracticality (thanks to Maxis!). Auto-resolving occurs when hovering the cursor of an interchange-based related item, such as Puzzle Pieces or interchange items, over existing sections of (non-reserved) network \u0026amp; Tabbing \u0026amp;/or Cycling through the different items attached to an Interchange-Based Related Menu Button. The game will automatically resolve only appropriate possible items for a given network in a given situation, when pressing the Tab \u0026amp;/or Home/End keyboard keys. Puzzle Pieces involving a two-tiled network, such as avenue \u0026amp; ground highway, may require the cursor be moved across the two-tiled area of the network when using the Home/End keys to access any/all of the possible configurations an item contains. There are some exceptions to this Auto-Resolving ability for some items, which typically depends on an items internal design. If in doubt, please experiment.
Diagonal-Based Puzzle Pieces # Many of the Network Puzzle Piece Menu Buttons \u0026amp;/or items now contain their Diagonal equivalent. In order to access Diagonal Puzzle Pieces, select a Puzzle Piece menu item \u0026amp; use the Home/End keyboard keys to rotate an item (where applicable). Note that not all items contain a Diagonal equivalent.
The same \u0026ldquo;How To Use\u0026rdquo; principles described above \u0026amp; depicted below apply to Diagonal-Based Puzzle Pieces, as they do with normal (straight-based) Puzzle Pieces. Diagonal-Based Puzzle Pieces though may take a little bit more practice, patience, and trial and error to fully utilise. Please note that all of the Diagonal-Based Puzzle Pieces have specifically been made the way they are for a reason - their (unorthodox) design makes them much more interchangeable with each other \u0026amp; all the rest of the puzzle pieces, thus making them much more versatile.
The following tries to illustrate how Puzzle Pieces must be used in order for them to work properly as intended:
You must have 3 Tiles of Street laid down already before you build the Road over Street Puzzle Piece. It must be done like this. With Puzzle Pieces that are 1x2, 2x1, or 2x2 etc tiles, the arrangement \u0026amp; set-up may be a little different but the same principles as this apply.
OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces: How to use? # Because OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces flow of traffic only travels in any one direction, using them is a little different from other Puzzle Pieces. The same principles above apply to OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces. The only difference is the Starting \u0026amp; Ending Pieces. If you use \u0026ldquo;OneWayRoad Starting Piece - ON\u0026rdquo; on one end of an extended overpass, you must use \u0026ldquo;OneWayRoad Ending Piece - OFF\u0026rdquo; on the other end of the extended overpass.
Many of the OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces now contain Directional Arrows to assist with their placement \u0026amp; general use. OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces should be placed \u0026amp; linked together according to these Directional Arrows, where applicable, in order for them to work \u0026amp; function properly. Fail to do so may result with whole sections of raised OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces not working properly at all.
The following gives an example illustration on how this should be done with OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces in order for them to work properly as intended:
GLR Puzzle Pieces: How to use? # Ground Light Rail (GLR) Puzzle Pieces are basically Elevated Rail tracks on ground level. Use the Elevated to Ground Light Rail transition to connect both. It is recommended that you use Draggable GLR instead of GLR Puzzle Pieces whenever possible. Since the NAM doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain lots, you have to install GLR stations separately. vester_DK has created a list of all available GLR stations in the Simtropolis forums.
Draggable GLR: How to use it? # Draggable GLR can be used similar like the in-game network tools. You have to place a special starter puzzle piece first that will indicate the direction of the draggable GLR. Use the in-game el-rail tool for dragging GLR tracks. Please note: Due to certain restrictions, the preview still shows up in the same height as the el-rail tracks. At the moment, this cannot be changed.
With draggable GLR, you have almost the same liberties as with any other draggable network. For some special cases it\u0026rsquo;s still necessary to use puzzle pieces, though, such as a GLR x El-Rail intersection.The existing GLR stations need to be updated for placing them directly onto draggable GLR. A patch with updated files is available as a separate download. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to bulldoze the existing GLR network or existing stations in your city, and the patch won\u0026rsquo;t affect stations that have been placed already, however you might want to update your GLR setup to draggable GLR anyway, since it\u0026rsquo;s more flexible and less prone to crashes. You can connect GLR puzzle pieces and draggable GLR with the starter puzzle pieces (which also serve as transition pieces) at any time.
Limitations # Puzzle Pieces currently have some limitations \u0026amp;/or known issues with them, and are as follows:
The Data View Map Congestions \u0026amp; Data View Map Volume Traffic Overlays do not always appear fully on all the different Puzzle Pieces (there is a reason for this). They will still show up in the Data View Map itself though.
Puzzle Pieces come under the same scope as being Interchange-base Related Item(s).

More Dual/Double-Decker Network Pieces may or may not be added with future updates.
The above Dual/Double-Decker Network Pieces works by using the HOME/END and TAB key(s) on your keyboard. HOME/END rotates the Piece on the cursor [where possible], and TAB cycles through the different Pieces that belongs to that menu button. When you TAB from one Piece to another, the type of Piece is displayed in the TEXT on the cursor itself [where possible].
What is Dual/Double-Decker Networking? # Dual/Double-Decker Networking is similar to Puzzle Pieces, essentially allowing Two Networks to run parallel one on top of the other along the same stretch of tile(s), simultaneously, allowing more than one form of Transport to use the same stretch of tile(s) at the same time for commuting purposes.
Note: When using this item in front of zones, it is best if an area is zoned first before laying this item down, otherwise the zones may not face the direction you want. If in doubt, please experiment.
Limitations # The limitations for Dual/Double-Decker Network Pieces are the same as per Puzzle Pieces above.
Dual/Double-Decker Network Pieces come under the same scope as being Interchange-base Related Item(s).
U-Drive-It # U-Drive-It (UDI) for Elevated Rail (EI Rail) has now been included with this mod. Currently, only \u0026ldquo;Free Drive Mode\u0026rdquo; is available for Elevated Rail Train/Station.
Where to find? # UDI for EI Rail is located under the \u0026ldquo;U Drive It\u0026rdquo; Panel, in the \u0026ldquo;Earned Land Vehicles\u0026rdquo; menu, half-way down the menu just before the Menu Icon for Monorail UDI.
How to use? # In order to use UDI EI Rail, you need to build an Elevated Rail Train Station. This will be the case regardless for a new city or an existing city. In other words; even in existing cities where there are already existing Elevated Rail Train Stations, you will still need to build an Elevated Rail Train station in order to be able to access UDI for EI Rail. If in doubt, please experiment.
Currently; UDI for EI Rail is not intended for use on \u0026ldquo;EI Rail-to-subway transitions\u0026rdquo;. Unfortunately, the game may still try to start UDI for EI Rail from an \u0026ldquo;EI Rail-to-subway transitions\u0026rdquo;. This side-affect is by design that this occurs.
UDI -cross platforms # With the advent of UDI for EI Rail, it should now be possible to take a UDI passenger train \u0026amp;/or UDI freight train, onto EI Rail via a custom made Transit Enabled Lot connecting ground rail to EI Rail. It should also now be possible to take a UDI EI Train onto ground rail via the same method. Just so long as the Custom Transit Enabled Lot has been made properly \u0026amp; with proper custom paths.
For more information regarding UDI EI Rail, please see the Technical Notes.
Additional Intersections \u0026amp; Junctions # This section lists Intersections, Junctions, \u0026amp;/or Network possibility types that have been made possible \u0026amp;/or are included in this mod \u0026amp;/or have had adjustments/fixes applied to them. All of the intersections, junctions \u0026amp;/or network possibility types in this section are achieved in-game using the standard Network tools, where applicable. i.e. Highway Tools, Avenue Tool, Road Tool, \u0026amp; so on.
Note: This list is not all inclusive \u0026amp; should only be considered as a guideline. Due to the multitude of items for this section, some items may exist that are currently not listed here or are not known, \u0026amp; as such this list may change. If in doubt, please experiment. Some known/unknown drawing, pathing \u0026amp;/or UDI issues may also exist with some items listed in this section.
Legend # Junction typically has the same meaning as Intersection, but may also encompass non-intersection type junctions. Orthogonal = Straight or follows the Grid. Diagonal = does not follow the grid. Curve = where the network changes from orthogonal to diagonal, visa versa or other similar variation. S-Curve = where the network changes from orthogonal to diagonal back to orthogonal in the shortest tile distance possible, visa versa or other similar variation. Corner = 90 degree turn or corner. + Junction = a four way intersection. T-Junction = a three way intersection. Offsplit = where a network comes off of the Curve of a network. The lists below are broken into two main Groups \u0026amp; items are listed by Network Set(s) according to Network Hierarchy, from lowest to highest (approximately). Group One involves only one network that have had additional intersections/etc items added for them i.e. no other networks are involved. Group Two is where more than one network is involved.
Group One # Items in this section only involve one network.
The items in this group are not in any particular or specific format.
Street # Roundabouts. To trigger the initial Street roundabout, you must draw a Street Circle in a 2x2 tile area. There currently exists many variations with one, two, three \u0026amp;/or four orthogonal \u0026amp;/or Diagonal Streets stemming from this initial 2x2 tile area. NOTE: Requires an additional Plugin. See Installation Instructions for details.
Diagonals. This requires 5 or more tiles to be zig zagged, like a set of steps or stairs, before the diagonals are triggered. Note: Requires an additional Plugin. See Installation Instructions for details.
You can also build a diagonal street via Diagonal Street helper puzzle pieces which can be used to build diagonal streets on sloped terrains or intersections. There are two types of them: normal puzzle pieces and construction puzzle pieces.
Road # Road Turning Lanes. Note: Requires an additional Plugin. See Installation Instructionsfor details.
Roundabouts. To trigger the initial Road roundabout, you must draw a Road Circle in a 2x2 tile area. There currently exists many variations with one, two, three \u0026amp;/or four orthogonal \u0026amp;/or Diagonal Roads stemming from this initial 2x2 tile area. Note: Requires an additional Plugin. See Installation Instructions for details.
OneWayRoad # Double Diagonal
Roundabouts. To trigger the initial OneWay roundabout, you must draw a OneWayRoad Circle in a 3x3 tile area. There currently exists many variations with one, two, three \u0026amp;/or four orthogonal \u0026amp;/or Diagonal OneWayRoads stemming from this initial 3x3 tile area. Note: Requires an additional Plugin. See Installation Instructions for details.
Avenue # The Avenue Tool/Network has been significantly modified, is much more flexible \u0026amp; now contains well over an additional 35+ new intersections, junctions \u0026amp;/or set-up possibility types, some of which we may not even be aware of yet. The listings for this section is to primarily give users an idea of what kind of junctions are now possible, as there may exist various different kinds of set-ups for a given listing. So if in doubt, please experiment.
Note: Due to the complexity involved \u0026amp; the associated paths used for the many junctions added for the avenue network, it is strongly recommended that using any vehicles during UDI Mode not be \u0026ldquo;Snapped\u0026rdquo; to the network if attempting to travel through any of these new avenue junctions.

Rather than the seven shades of blue in the original, this version uses the full spectrum of color, including approximately 48 distinct color shades. The maximum volume shown for each travel type has been increased from a flat 1200 for all types in the original Traffic Volume View to a value which is 300% of the capacity of the underlying network for the selected travel type. (Since only one commute period is shown at a time, this is one half of the standard network capacity, which is calculated for a full day.) The legend has been increased from five to nine entries, and each color in the legend is followed by the percentage of the underlying network capacity that that color represents, as well as the actual number of Sims represented by that percentage. When a travel type may have more than one underlying network (e.g., cars may travel on streets, roads, or highways), a subtext below the legend indicates which network is being referenced in the display.
The colors in the display have been arranged so that they are more concentrated at lower levels, in order to give finer granularity at lower volumes. Between volumes of 0% and 10%, colors change about every 1.5%. Between 10% and 130%, colors change about ever 5%. And between 130% and 300%, colors change about every 10%. Please note that while every attempt has been made to attain the greatest accuracy possible, all numbers are somewhat approximate. The numbers following each color in the legend refer to the approximate beginning of the range of that particular color.
You may notice that starting at 100%, the colors follow those in the Traffic Congestion View. However, it is important to keep in mind the difference between theTraffic Congestion View and the Traffic Volume View. The Congestion View is compiled from an entire day\u0026rsquo;s travel statistics, while the Volume View refers to only a single commute period. Therefore, yellow in a single volume view does not necessarily indicate congestion, and blue or green in a single volume view does not necessarily indicate lack of congestion. Furthermore, some of the volume views include non-congestion producing travel types, which are pedestrians, buses, and ferries. An experienced player may be able to look at both commute periods of certain volume views and get a good idea of congestion, but it is necessary to be careful here.
The Traffic Volume View also includes a new Subway View. The new Subway View acts in most ways like the normal underground Subway View, which is entered by selecting the Subway Tool when you want to build or demolish subways. However, it has included in it the volume display feature of the Traffic Volume View, which allows you to see the usage of your subways as you are building (or demolishing) them. Like the rest of the Traffic Volume View, this view shows the volume of traffic in each subway line visible in the main map, as well as in all subway lines in the minimap.
The last feature included in the Traffic Volume View is a new Subway Building View, which is entered whenever you select a subway station to build. It differs from the standard Subway Building View in that no buildings other than subway stations are displayed; zones are displayed wherever possible; and like the Subway View, the volume of traffic in each subway line visible in the main map, as well as in all subway lines in the minimap. In addition, zones and transit station locations are shown in the minimap.
Finally, most transit station types light up in all volume views. This does not indicate anything about usage; it is simply so you can identify them easily. Certain types of transit stations do not light up because of the way they were designed.
A new Zones view is also included with the Traffic Volume View. The new Zones view is identical to the Subway Building View, except that subway volume levels are not displayed.

The new method currently supports tunnel portals for four networks in the RealHighway (RHW) plugin: the RHW-2, RHW-3, RHW-4, and the MIS Ramp.
The menu button used to access the Subway-based FLUPs content is located under the Highways menu, and it contains the items listed below:
RHW Flex-FLUPs Button # FLEX FLUPs RHW Portal FLEX FLUPs Road Portal FLEX FLUPs One-Way Road Portal Underground Road-2 (URoad-2) Starter Piece (for use with RHW-2 and Road portals) Underground Road-3 (URoad-3) Starter Piece Underground Ramp (URamp) Starter Piece Underground Road-4 (URoad-4) Starter Piece (for use with RHW-4 and One-Way Road portals) Underground Road-6S (URoad-6S) Starter Piece Street FLEX Overcrossing Road FLEX Overcrossing One-Way Road FLEX Overcrossing Avenue FLEX Overcrossing Street FLEX Overcrossing RHW FLEX Overcrossing Rail FLEX Overcrossing Light Rail FLEX Overcrossing Monorail FLEX Overcrossing Ground Highway FLEX Overcrossing Elevated Highway FLEX Overcrossing To begin constructing a Subway-based FLUPs system, first place the Tunnel Portals at the desired entrance and exit points for your underground route:
To start the underground portion itself (new instructions as of NAM 41), either place down one of the network starter pieces, and drag the Subway network through it (note: it may not be visible until dragging Subway through it), and between the portals, or build the Subway first, place the starter piece on top of it (using the Traffic Data View as a guide), then click in the vicinity with the Subway tool to convert it to the appropriate network.
As the Portal is FLEX-based, it can accept overrides, and be converted to other networks by simply connecting an override network into it. At present, the only accepted override networks, for the RHW portal, the RHW-3, RHW-4, RHW-6S, and MIS Ramp, while the Road and One-Way Road portals presently do not accept overides. To make this conversion, simply place the starter piece of the desired override network somewhere before the start of the Portal, and drag it into the ground end. (Note that this above ground action no longer affects the underground network directly\u0026ndash;this change was made in NAM 41 to improve the stability and reliability of the Subway-based FLUPs system.)
As noted before, the Subway-based override networks can be used to create curving tunnels. The premise for constructing these is the same as with any other override network. Note that the \u0026ldquo;sharp\u0026rdquo; bends to diagonal may break the override. Ensure the bend is at the proper angle to prevent reversion to the base Subway network.
Some minor glitches may appear near the starter pieces of the underground network after doing so; these are unavoidable and do not affect the functionality of the network.
Being that the underground network is Subway-based, it can cross under blank terrain, Zones, Buildings (Zoned or Plopped), and Parks and remain functional, without any issue or additional work. Much like the base Subway network, commuters and freight can \u0026ldquo;shortcut\u0026rdquo; to and from Zones/Buildings to the underground network\u0026ndash;this is an unavoidable part of game behavior. Being fully pathed as a standard Road or Highway-type network underground, all three Transit Types normally associated with those networks\u0026ndash; Cars, Buses, and Freight Trucks\u0026ndash;can use the Subway-based FLUPs. Note, however, that the Subway-based FLUPs cannot cross standard Subways.
While it is physically possible to build other networks over top of the Subway-based FLUPs, doing so will normally block traffic and render the underground network non-functional. This can, however, be circumvented by using the FLEX Overcrossing Pieces (FLEX-OCPs). To build an overcrossing, simply find the FLEX piece for the appropriate network, place it down, and reconnect the network through the gap created by the Construction Tile. To ensure proper placement over top of the underground network, use one of the game\u0026rsquo;s Traffic DataViews, like the Traffic Congestion DataView (pictured) or the Traffic Volume Data View, in order to locate it.
If built properly, a textured red ribbon should appear across the spot where the undercrossing exists when one hovers over it with one of the Query tools. If the underground network is carrying traffic, it should be visible here with the Traffic Query. (Note that the underground network itself will not register traffic on the Traffic Query, due to the game not being set up to report Car/Bus/Freight Truck traffic on the Subway network.)
Given that the overcrossing is FLEX-based, it can convert to match supported override networks for that base network. Below, the Road FLEX Overcrossing Piece was converted to L1 Road Viaduct, simply by hooking the L1 Road Viaduct Starter into it.
The following override networks are supported by each of the following Overcrossing Pieces:
Road: L1 Road Viaduct, L2 Road Viaduct, TLA-3, AVE-2, ARD-3, NRD-4, TLA-5, RD-4, RD-6, TLA-7, AVE-6 One-Way Road (OWR): L1 OWR Viaduct, L2 OWR Viaduct, OWR-1, OWR-3, OWR-4, OWR-5 Avenue: L1 Avenue Viaduct, L2 Avenue Viaduct Rail (RRW): Single-Track Rail (STR) Elevated (Light) Rail/Tram:: Ground Light Rail (GLR\u0026ndash;all styles) RealHighway (RHW): All RHW override networks The following override/FLEX/puzzle networks are NOT supported at present:
Street Addon Mod (SAM) Override Networks High Speed Rail Project (HSRP) Override Networks L1 and L2 Rail (ERRW) Viaducts Hybrid Railway (HRW) Alternate Viaducts GLR/Tram-in-Avenue (TiA) GLR/Tram-in-Road (TiR) GLR/Tram-on-Road (ToR) GLR/Tram-on-Street (ToS) Elevated (Light) Rail (ELR)-over-Road (EoR) Elevated (Light) Rail (ELR)-over-Avenue (EoA) Elevated (Light) Rail (ELR)-over-RD-4 (EoRD-4) Additional Notes # Crossings involving diagonals are also not supported at present. U-Drive-It (UDI) functionality is also unfortunately not possible with the Subway-based override network. The old puzzle pieces do still support UDI. The transit types supported by the FLEX FLUPs portals are Cars, Buses, and Freight Trucks. The portals and the URoad networks do not support Pedestrian/Sim paths, nor any other transit type. The Monorail and Elevated Highway FLEX Overcrossings may produce indestructible shadows. This has proven thus far to be unavoidable and uncorrectable. Much as with the previous puzzle-based FLUPs, which are Road-based, due to how the Traffic Simulator\u0026rsquo;s hardcoded aspects inherit properties for networks using unexpected transit types, the capacity and speed for the Subway-based FLUPs are also identical to that of the Road network. The new FLEX-based FLUPs Portals do support nightlighting. To see the nightlighting on the Portals, ensure they are connected to Power. Both Maxis Nite and Dark Nite options are available. Maxis Nite is installed by default, but Dark Nite may be selected under the \u0026ldquo;7_Texture and Drive Side\u0026rdquo; section of the NAM installer, under each texture/drive-side combination. When bulldozing the new URoad starter pieces, the starter may appear in the above ground view after demolition while in Subway view. To fully remove it, demolish it in the above ground view as well. The Road and One-Way Road portals are designed to hook into the URoad-2 and URoad-4 networks, respectively. There are no separate underground networks for use with these portals, nor are there any plans to add them. Old Method: Puzzle Pieces # This documentation has not yet been written.

This documentation was last updated with NAM 35. It is in the process of being rewritten. Preface # Overview # The Maxis Highway Override (abbreviated MHO ), sometimes called Project Symphony (abbreviated PS), is an attempt to join the Maxis Highways (abbreviated as MHW) with the Real Highway Mod (RHW) by the total conversion of the MHW. The new MHW will have the specifications of the RHW. It looks like an RHW, rides like an RHW but is built like an MHW.
For new users unfamiliar with the RHW, the MHO can be a first step at getting familiar with the RHW paradigm. However, for experienced users who know their way around RHW, this can be a very powerful supplement to existing RHW systems.
NOTE: When reading this document, there may be key terms to take note of or terms that are used differently than normal. This includes the following terms:
Bridge and Overpass : In the field of transit modding, bridges over other networks and bridges over water and ravines are two completely different things. A bridge that goes over another network is an overpass. A bridge that goes over water is what is considered a bridge. Overpasses and elevated networks have a fixed height, and have to be placed using starters, whereas bridges have to be selected through the bridge selection window, and have a variable height throughout the entire length. Carriageway : This may be used as a synonym for a single one-way RHW. Diagonal : This refers to being at a 45-degree angle to the SimCity 4 grid. Highway : This term will be used universally to refer to freeway, expressway, interstate, divided highway, and dual carriageway. LHD and RHD : Left-hand drive and right-hand drive instead refer to which side of the road you drive on, not which side of the car you drive in. Orthogonal : This is a synonym for “ perpendicular ” in certain mathematical fields, but in the field of Transit Network Modding, it instead refers to being in line, or parallel, with the SimCity 4 grid. Perpendicular is used instead for networks crossing at 90-degree angles. Compatibility # The NAM and its plugins are only compatible with SimCity 4 \u0026ldquo;Rush Hour\u0026rdquo; or SimCity 4 Deluxe , Version 1.1.638 or higher. It is required that you install the SimCity 4 EP1 Update 1 Patch (for Version 1.1.638) before proceeding with installation. If you have purchased SimCity 4 Deluxe from Steam or another digital retailer, the Version number will be 1.1.641, and should be pre- patched.
Attempting to use this mod with other versions of SimCity 4 will cause the game to instantly crash upon loading.

Feel free to modify the items for yourself and show them in your city journals, but please don\u0026rsquo;t distribute them without asking first.
Installation and Setup # IMPORTANT!!! IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO CREATE A BACKUP OF YOUR CITIES AND YOUR PLUGINS FOLDER IN THE EVENT THAT SOMETHING GOES WRONG. IF SOMETHING DOES GO WRONG, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO RESTORE YOUR PREVIOUS FILES.
In order to install the Maxis Highway Override Mod using the NAM Installer , you need to select the option for it. If you decide to install this at a later time, simply run the installer again.
NOTE: Since the RHW is required to use this plugin, the RHW will also be automatically selected.
If you are using a Left-Hand Drive installation (cars driving on the left), be sure to select the LHD Plugin.
Within the z___NAM folder should be a folder named Maxis Highway Override. This is where the files for this plugin are found. The files contained are as follows:

In this era, the NAM Team created various MHW interchange pieces, such as the MHW Stack, the OxD MHW Interchange, and various three-way interchanges. However, this was always a time-consuming task, due to the MHWs being hard to modify and their under-scaled dimensions, and progressively fewer MHW items were made.
With the advent of RHW Version 3.0, it was now possible to create RHW interchanges solely using RHW. With the RHW’s increasing popularity, more and more modding effort was devoted towards RHW, eventually leaving out MHW out of the interest of modders. However, even before RHW began to overtake MHW, there have been attempts at converting the MHW to a more realistic setup, the most notable at the time was Shadow Assassin’s Urban Highway Mod , but this mod was never released.
During recent years and during P57’s development, the idea was revitalised and experimented with by many NAM Team Members, such as Tarkus (Alex) and GDO29Anagram (Ganaram). These ideas were later picked up by jdenm8 and MandelSoft , and expanded upon with the addition of RHW-styled Ramp Interfaces, and eventually, semi-prefab interchanges. The NAM 31 includes the first public release of this mod.

Functionality, Networks, and Networks Types # Because this is a mod that overrides an existing network, Project Symphony networks are identical in function to the original Maxis Highways, as much of the original function is retained. The following networks are included.
Ground-Level Highways # The Ground Level Maxis Highway , or Height Level 0 Maxis Highway (abbreviated as L MHW ) is a fully draggable two-tile network. Both halves of the highway are dragged at the same time.
Project Symphony completely overrides the narrow 2x3 lane Maxis Highway with a wide 2x2 lane RHW-like highway. This means that all your existing Maxis Highways will be replaced by the MHO design. In other words, this is not a starter-override network, but rather, a complete revamp of the base network.
The network has barriers all the way; it has a single centre barrier and two outer barriers, making them distinctive from the RHW.
Shown left to right: Project Symphony MHW and Dual RHW-4.
The L0 MHW can’t cross any network at-grade. You need to transition into another network first, like AVE-4 or RHW-4. This is because it’s a limited access network and slow traffic is banned here.
Elevated Highways # The Elevated Highway , or Height Level 2 Maxis Highway (abbreviated as L2 MHW ) is a fully draggable two-tile network. Like its L0-counterpart, this is also a complete override, but only 15 meters higher than its ground level counterpart. It may look a lot like a Dual RHW-4; the only difference is that it only has a single centre barrier instead of a double one.
Shown left to right: MHO MHW (L2) and Dual RHW-4 (L2). Note the difference between the pillars and the barriers.
MIS Network # The MIS Ramp , also called MIS Network or just MIS , is a network designed for interchanging traffic between any two RHW networks, or between an RHW network and a non-RHW network. It’s the backbone for designing custom interchanges.
Because of its importance with interchanging traffic, this network can create at-grade crossings with almost every other network.
The Maxis Highway Override uses this network from the RHW, since it would be useless to create two networks with the same function. Therefore, the RHW is a necessary dependency for this mod to work properly. Just with the MHWs, MIS also has a ground-level and elevated version, though the MIS has four elevated counterparts.
NOTE: If you installed the NAM using the NAM Installer, the RHW should be automatically installed when you installed Project Symphony.
Tunnels and Bridges # Tunnels # The tunnels for MHW have been repurposed and remodeled to be compatible for the newly- designed MHWs. This requires a custom slope mod, which is also included.
Bridges # The MHO includes two bridges: an L0 Level Bridge and an L2 Level Bridge. The bridges made for Dual RHW-4 can also be used. Due to the slight height differences between Ground MHO Highways and RHW-4, a bridge transition is included to properly transition between the two
Networks # For additional options, it is also possible to use AVE-4 bridges, though these bridges will have a lower capacity.
Puzzle-based Items # Puzzle-based items are static items that can be used for different purposes. These items can be found under the Highways Menu. In order to navigate through the different types of pieces, you must press the TAB key, and to go back, press SHIFT+TAB. To rotate a selected puzzle piece, press the Home and End keys. A comprehensive list of what items are included can be found in
The current Maxis Highway Override contains the following Puzzle-based items:
Ramp Interfaces # Just like the RHW, the Maxis Highway Override has the ability to create custom interchanges. Since making prefabs takes a lot of work and are incredibly inflexible, and that real-life interchanges can be incredibly massive (exceeding the 16x16 tile maximum for puzzle pieces), there instead exists a set of ramp interfaces designed to complement the MIS network.
The MHO borrows many components of the RHW’s Modular Interchange System , a set of interchange pieces which can be assembled in an infinite number of combinations to create any type of interchange. The MHO also adds in its own pieces, but compared to RHW, the selection of features it adds in itself is fairly limited.
These pieces are found under the Ramps Button , located under the buttons from the base networks of the mod.
Curves # Wide Radius Curves allow for a smoother and more realistic turn-radius, enhancing the look and feel of curving networks. These pieces are found under the Curves Button.
This button also contains the Fractional Angled MHW (FAMHW). These pieces are neither orthogonal nor diagonal. These can be used for extremely gentle curves and for going against the orthogonal-diagonal grid in general.
Transitions # Transitions allow you to switch between two different heights of MHW or between different networks. There are two types of height Transitions: Ramp Transitions , which switch between two height levels of MHW, and OnSlope Transitions , which are Height Transitions that have to be placed on slopes. These pieces are found under the Transitions Button.
Prefabs and Semi-Prefabs # Prefabs are pre-made interchanges. These interchanges are very static, but also very easy to build. The original MHW had a lot of those interchanges, but the MHO only offers a very limited amount of them.
There are two kinds of prefabs: Total Prefabs , which are complete interchanges with connections and everything, and Semi-Prefabs , which only contain a part of the interchange and require ramps to be connected later on. Semi-prefabs are a little harder to build, but they are also more flexible than total prefabs.
Tips, Tricks, and Tutorials # Starting off with Project Symphony # As quoted directly from the original SimCity 4 Deluxe User’s Manual , “Highways are very expensive compared to [other networks], and tend to take up a lot of space, but their capacity [and] speed limits are [very] high.” This is still true in Project Symphony.
In fact, most of the traditional crossings with both ground and elevated highways have been modified and are still available, as with the original “humpback” overpasses with Road and Rail. Roads and other networks can still cross under Elevated Highways, and Elevated Rail and Monorail can still cross over Ground Highways. Additionally, other networks added by the NAM (HSR, NWM, RHW) will still cross with these networks.
As these networks are base networks and are “natural” to begin with, both MHW and EMHW will still create neighbour connections as before, and the need of neighbour connection pieces is not necessary.
However, for cities that already have the original Highway Interchanges or the NAM’s Custom Interchanges, none of these interchanges will fit with the revamped highways. Because of the large scaling differences between the original interchanges and the revamped highways, it was decided by the NAM Team that none of these interchanges will be modified.
All original MHW interchanges are incompatible with the Maxis Highway Override and it is recommended to bulldoze and replace them if you have these in your cities. Also, all of the original MHW Interchange menu buttons are disabled; however, several interchanges can still be accessed using Autoplace. Refrain from using these interchanges; they may still work, but they will be visually incompatible with the MHO.
Understanding Ramp Interfaces # Unlike the RHW, there are only four types of Ramp Interfaces available: A1, B1, D1, and E1, each diagrammed below from left to right.
Types A1 and B1 (shown left) branch one lane outwards while retaining the two original lanes of the highway. The branch connects with MIS. Types D1 and E1 split the highway into two MIS.
Types A1 and D1 have a parallel branch, while Types B1 and E1 have a branch at a 45-degree angle.
Using Dual RHW-4 Bridges with the Maxis Highway Override # Bridges made for RHW-4 can be used with the MHO. When you build a Dual RHW-4 bridge for a stretch of MHW, you’ll see a subtle height shift:
This is because the MHW is raised 0.75m at ground level. Therefore, under the Transition Menu, a Bridge Transition piece is included. Hover this piece over the stretch of MHW and plop it over the network with the lower end facing the bridge. This will result in a much more gentle transition:
Using RHW with the Maxis Highway Override # The Maxis Highway Override is also designed to work with the RHW. You can simply drag the MHW over or under stretches of RHW without any problems. Moreover, you can transition the MHW into a RHW-4. Both MHWs can transition to their respective RHW-4 counterparts with no issues.
You can also use MHO interchanges for the RHW and vice versa; they will seamlessly transit into each other. For example, the Roundabout Interchange made for the MHO can be made to interface RHW-6S:
Additionally, the MHWs can also be drawn in conjunction with RHW to create a hybrid Multi-RHW.
Interchange Construction # The Maxis Highway Override includes pieces to construct a few types of interchanges. This requires the use of the RHW’s Modular Interchange System. These interchanges are not limited to only the MHO.
The tutorials shown here rely on both MHO and RHW. More advanced tutorials and other interchange designs can be found on the RHW Interchange Guide. The rest is limited to your imagination.
PROTIP: Most interchanges require starting construction at the inside and gradually building out from the centre. This has everything to do with the line-up of all stretches. Keep that in mind as a strategy when you try to build a custom designed interchange.
Diamond interchange # Diamond Interchanges are very simple in design and involve a highway with an arterial road going over or under it. The offramps and onramps create a diamond-like shape with the arterial road, hence the name.
Drag a stretch of L0 MHW. Drag out Road perpendicular to the RHW, starting four tiles away. Do this for both sides of the highway.
Place the Road over MHW Piece (found in the Roads Menu ) on top of the MHW, in the place as shown. This is where the Road will go over the MHW.
Place the Road-MIS Intersection next to the Road over MHW Pieces as shown. Rotate these pieces accordingly. The markings may be very subtle to notice. This is where the MIS will cross with the Road. Do this for both sides of the interchange.
Place the Road Start/End Piece so that it joins with the Road-MIS intersection and the Road. This will connect the overpass with the ground. If the Road on the ground is too close that it gets in the way with placing the Start/End Piece, bulldoze it until it’s at least three tiles from the Road-MIS intersection.
Place an L0-L2 MIS Starterless Height Transition connecting to the Road-MIS crossing. This is found the RHW Transitions Button. This will join the Ramp Interface with the Road. Make sure that the Transition is the correct one, as indicated by the arrows and the word “ON” or “OFF” in the name of the piece. Do this for each of the quadrants.
Place the Type A1 Ramps at the MHW to connect the transitions with the MHW. Do this for each of the quadrants. The completed interchange is quite larger compared to the original Diamond Interchange, but is still very compact.
Roundabout Interchanges # Roundabout Interchanges rely on a Roundabout to interchange traffic. This is a space-saving alternative to building other types of interchanges, with the downside that it isn’t very high- capacity. Constructing both the two-level and three-level Roundabout are similar to each other.
Two-level and Three-level Roundabout Interchanges # Drag one long stretch of Ground Highway (L0) and two small stretches of Elevated Highway (L2) perpendicular to the Ground Highway and two tiles away. Make sure that you don’t drag the elevated highway straight across; this will prevent the autoplace message for the MHW Stack Interchange to appear. If you do drag the elevated highway straight across and you get the message, simply cancel the message.
Select from the Prefabs Menu the L0xL2 Three-Level Roundabout Interchange and plop it directly in the middle. This is the core of the entire interchange. If you are using the L0xL2 Two-Level Roundabout , you will notice that the Roundabout is at L2, and that the highway directly connects to the Roundabout.
Plop the L0-L1 and L1-L2 MIS Transitions (Found in the Maxis Highway Override Transitions Button), or L0-L2 MIS Starterless Height Transitions for the Two-Level Roundabout (Found in the RHW Transitions Button), at the open ramp ends. This will bring interchanging traffic to and from the highways to the roundabout. You will need eight transitions in total for the Three-Level Roundabout, or four transitions for the Two-Level Roundabout. Keep an eye on the direction of the transitions! Also follow the name of the transitions!
Finally, plop the Type A1 Ramps at the ends of the height transitions to complete this interchange. Eight ramps are needed in total for the Three-Level Roundabout, and four ramps are needed for the Two-Level Roundabout. Afterwards, extend out your highways if needed. The closest analogue to the Roundabout Interchange is the MHW Stack Interchange , in terms of how much space one takes compared to the other.
A Note about the Two-Level Roundabout # The Two-level Roundabout was more designed for connecting a highway (L0 MHW) and an arterial network (Avenue), rather than connecting two highways together. The upper connections can be connected to an MHW Ground to Elevated Transition and then transitioned back to Avenue at ground-level, or the connection can be made directly to Elevated Avenue using the Elevated Avenue to Elevated Highway Transition.
T-Stack Interchanges # The Maxis Highway Override includes only one type of Prefab Interchange: The T-Stack Interchange. Due to a design decision regarding how to implement this type of interchange, this will be the only prefab interchange to be added in the NAM.
This piece is found under the Prefabs Button. Pressing Home and End will rotate between the different height combinations. Drag out the corresponding Highway network out of the stubs after placing.
Alternatively, the T-Stack piece can be placed on top of an already-drawn Highway network. If these networks are already drawn in a T, be sure that the two networks don’t connect. Doing so may trigger building the original MHW T-Stack Interchange. The height levels between the two highways don’t matter, since the proper interchange will always be assigned.
Cloverleaf Interchanges # Cloverleaf Interchanges are one of the first interchange designs used to interchange traffic between two highways. This requires giant loops to interchange left-turning traffic (or right- turning traffic in LHD), with the resulting shape of the interchange bearing semblance to a four- leaf clover, hence the name
Full Cloverleaf Interchange # Drag your L0 MHW stretch first. Drag a small stretch of L2 MHW over it so that it crosses perpendicularly with the L0 MHW. The ground highway needs to be fairly long, and the elevated highway needs to be about 12 or 14 tiles long. This is to prevent triggering the autoplace window for the original MHW Stack Interchange.
Plop the Type A1 ramps at the centre first. Keep one tile between the overpass and the ramp end. Eight ramps are needed in total, four for the elevated highway and four more for the ground highway.
Plop the Cloverleaf Ramps to connect the ends of the ramps. This piece is found under the Curves Button. The cursor for these pieces is positioned at the end of the ramp pieces. This will create the turn loops. Do this for all four quadrants.
Place down a Ground to Elevated Highway Transition at the ends of the Elevated Highway. This will transition down the Elevated Highway back to the ground. Do this for both ends of the Interchange. Drag out a stretch of Ground Highway out from the stubs.
Drag a diagonal stretch of RHW right next to the cloverleaf ramps. This will create the shape of the right-turn ramps (or left-turn in LHD).
Place down a MIS Starter at one end of the diagonal RHW. Be sure that the yellow line* is on the inside. Bulldoze the construction handle and connect the starter to the diagonal RHW using the RHW Tool.
Click outwards from the starter to convert the RHW into MIS. Demolish the orthogonal starters afterwards.
Place down Type B1 Ramps to connect the diagonal MIS to the highway. Use the RHW Tool to connect the MIS to the Ramps.
Repeat steps 5 to 8 for the remaining ramps to complete the interchange. The final interchange, shown below, is far larger than the original Cloverleaf Interchange. However, the immense size actually brings the MHO Cloverleaf within reasonable real-life scaling.
*NOTE: if you use the Euro Textures, there will be no yellow lines; all lines are white in the Euro textured version. In that case, keep an eye on the shoulder lanes or direction arrows at starters. When you use Right Hand Drive (RHD) , make the loop around the cloverleaf interchange is counter-clockwise. With Left Hand Drive (LHD) , this should be clockwise.
Half Cloverleaf Interchange # The Half Cloverleaf is a variant of the Full Cloverleaf that acts as a three-way junction. It is essentially half of a cloverleaf; only two of the loops and two of the right-turn ramps are present. Additionally, the interchange itself can be upgraded into a Full Cloverleaf if needed.
Drag one single stretch of Ground Highway. This will create the upper “bar” of the interchange.
Place down two Type A1 Ramps. Make sure that they are four tiles from each other.
Drag two four-tile stretches of RHW so that they both bisect the Ground Highway. Make sure these are two tiles apart. This will become the MIS overpasses.
Place an L2 MIS starter on the two RHW “stubs”. This will override the RHW into the needed overpass. Be sure to keep the yellow lines* on the inside. After which, bulldoze the construction lots on the starters and extend each MIS out by four tiles in each direction.
Place two Cloverleaf Ramps as shown. This will connect the overpasses with the ramps.
Place down two L0-L2 MIS Starterless Height Transitions. This will bring the overpasses to the ground.
Place down two MIS S-curves.
Place down two Type E1 Ramps. Make sure they connect with the MIS curves. Follow steps 5 through 8 for the Full Cloverleaf to connect the Type E1 Ramps with the other highway to complete the rest of the interchange.

Frequently Asked Questions # Questions Regarding Compatibility with Pre-existing MHWs # Can this mod work side-by-side with the original MHWs? # No. This mod is a complete replacement. However, this is an optional NAM component, so you can choose whether to install it or not.
Do I need to demolish any pre-existing MHWs? # Most of the draggable content will be ported over with no problems. Especially there will be quite a lot of diagonal functionality from the first release, something uncommon with other NAM items. However, you probably need to demolish the interchanges, since those are not converted due to lots of modeling work and vast under-scaling. However, you will be able to build other kinds of interchanges as a replacement with some help of the RHW.
Questions Regarding Functionality and General Features # Why is the RHW installed along with the MHO? # Unlike other override mods in the past, the Maxis Highway Override is the only override mod that features puzzle pieces. Since these pieces rely on parts of the RHW, the RHW will be automatically installed along with the MHO.
Can this be used to draw RHWs? # Technically, no. Since the MHO overrides existing networks, rather than using a starter, RHWs can’t be drawn using the MHO.
Why aren’t there any starters on the Ramp Interfaces? # This will allow you to build more compact interchanges. Starters tend to get in the way in that they take up one extra tile of space, particularly on uneven terrain. There will be stubs however. You can use the starters from the RHW for the ramp construction.
Will there be any prefab interchanges? # No. The massive amount of time required in making one, the size limits imposed on them, the fact that they would duplicate already existing functionality, along with the rigid inflexibility of such setups, the underscaled dimensions of these interchanges and the massive number that would have to be made in order to account for all the networks both MHW and RHW renders the notion of plop interchanges impractical and unworkable. Semi-prefabs will probably the biggest components that will be realised.
The only exception is the T-Interchange.
What about the original interchanges? Won’t those be changed? # No. The original interchanges are too small to work with, and therefore will not be converted.
When I was reading through the documentation, I noticed that this included its own slope mod. I’m using a different slope mod. How do I make the MHO/PS Slope Mod work with the other one I have? # In order to make any other slope mod to work friendly with the Maxis Highway Override, the only value that should be changed is the Ground Highway Placement Tuning Parameters Exemplar file (TGI: 0x6534284A, 0x084344E0, 0x0BE08C87). You only need to set the TunnelModelHeights parameter to “9.25, 9.25”, though setting the MinTerrainSlopeForTunnelStart to 10 is recommended. These values have to be modified using Ilive’s Reader.
Questions Regarding Tunnels and Bridges # Are there tunnels and bridges? # The current Maxis Highway bridges have generally proven very difficult to convert. Only the Level Bridges have received the MHO treatment. For addition bridge styles, you will have to use Avenue Bridges instead, or some of the new dual RHW-4 Bridges. For the tunnels, there will be a 7.5m high ground level tunnel override available, which will require a custom slope mod (included in the mod).
What’s the issue with bridges? # In short, the models for the original MHW bridge are hard to convert to MHO due to the differences in S3D settings and scaling. It isn’t as easy as slipping a small plane that has the RHW texture on it.
What about tunnels for other RHW networks? Is there a way to make it work? # There’s no easy solution for “hijacking” the MHW tunnels and repurposing them such that they bear the tunnel entrance and paths of an RHW network other than dual RHW-4, and many of these complications are EXE-locked and therefore unfixable.
First, the same paths are used for both sides of the MHW tunnel, making asymmetrical pathing impossible, so two-tile RHWs, such as RHW-8S, are out of the question. Secondly, only one tunnel model can be used for each tunnel, since there is no way to drag out and select different tunnels the same way that bridges can be selected and drawn. Thirdly, changing the function of a feature that already works, the MHW tunnels, so that another mod can use is not good practise, as it will cause existing tunnels to cease functioning.
Questions Regarding Cross-Compatibility with Other Mods # Can this work with RHW? # It most certainly can. It’s designed to do just that.
Can this work with other MHW mods? # That depends on what type of mod it is. If it’s a mod that modifies the models, such as the HRS , then it will actually conflict with the Maxis Highway Override. Simple textural mods that work for MHW will not even work with MHO, since the MHO references completely different textures.
T21 modifications may still continue to work with MHO, but depending on how the props are placed, they may be misaligned with the new dimensional specifications.
Questions Regarding Textures # I want to change the textures. What should I look for? # First, you need to know how to mod textures. There are several tutorials about that. The important thing is that the override textures have the same IDs as the original ones. You can find the original textures in the DAT-files of the RHW for reference. You can check out the Maxis Highway Override DATs for texture references of every model. However, changes to MHO textures will also have effect on the elevated RHW. Keep that in mind.
What about Euro Textures? # These are available and included in the NAM.
Questions Regarding General Development # When it will be out? # It will be ready when it’s ready. Besides, who doesn’t like surprises? ;)

One of the main ways this was initially accomplished was by using a much more accurate version of the pathfinding heuristic than had been available in previous traffic simulators. Also, the Sims\u0026rsquo; maximum commute time was increased to give them enough time to get to work. These changes allow a smoother distribution of traffic throughout the city, with typically less congestion. At the same time, the congestion that does exist no longer leads to abandonment due to commute time in well-built cities; Sims know that they occasionally have to sit through traffic jams, and are a bit more patient. Better pathfinding also means that Sims act much smarter about finding jobs and routes to them; this also results in less abandonment due to commute time. As in the real world, zones can be farther apart without causing problems; this is especially helpful when building existing cities to scale, which can now be done reliably. Finally, running the pathfinder with near-optimum settings allows the simulator to run up to several times as fast as previous traffic simulators.
The second major area of work on the original Simulator Z involved a more flexible distribution of traffic among the various travel types. In combination with the pathfinder upgrading, this allows buses to be counted toward traffic and congestion, just like all other vehicles. This is a significant change from all previous simulators, and it\u0026rsquo;s an important point to remember when planning your transportation infrastructure. More flexible distribution of traffic also means that the NAM Traffic Simulator is much more dynamic about allowing Sims to choose their transportation. In cities with excellent highways and road capacity, car usage has been measured at over six times that of previous simulators. Yet for cities with less extensive road networks and reasonable mass transit, car usage is actually less than in previous traffic simulators.
Simulator Changes # Version 3.0 of the NAM Traffic Simulator contains the following changes from the previous version of the simulator: # Multiple parameters in the traffic simulator that affect pathfinding were tuned in order to greatly improve pathfinding. As the pathfinder is at the heart of the traffic simulator, this tuning made the other changes in this section possible. Early on in the development of version 3.0 of the traffic simulator, it was discovered that one of the most powerful ways of optimizing the pathfinder used congestion patterns and the associated traffic speed decreases to reroute traffic to less congested (and therefore faster) routes. This was done by modifying the pathfinder\u0026rsquo;s Congestion vs. Speed curve to be more aggressive. The Congestion vs. Speed (CvS) curve is used to determine how much speed decrease is associated with each degree of congestion. There are actually two slightly different Congestion vs. Speed curves used in this version of the traffic simulator. The first works best where there is at least some congestion present, and this one is included in the Classic and Low capacity versions of the simulator. The second version of this curve works equally well at all capacity levels of the simulator. However, since the first version of the CvS curve works significantly better than the second version for low capacity simulators, the second version is used only for the Medium, High, and Ultra versions of the simulator, since these capacity levels typically have little or no congestion, and the first version of the CvS curve would perform worse than the second under these circumstances. This has the following consequences: Since the first version of the CvS curve results in the best pathfinding performance in the two low capacity simulators where it can be used (Classic and Low), the Low capacity simulator is recommended for most cities. All capacity levels of the simulator result in noticebly reduced congestion compared to previous versions of the simulator used in identical cities. Specifically, when using the Low capacity simulator, typically only scattered congestion appears until a city passes a population of about 1.5 million Sims, and the congestion becomes serious around the level of 2 million Sims. However, as long as a city\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure is maintained appropriately for its population, the Low capacity can be used to support cities just as big as those supported by the Ultra capacity simulator, although cities may need additional transit infrastructure (most notably, subways) if the Low capacity simulator is used on large cities. Similarly, the Classic capacity simulator, which has half the capacities of the Low capacity simulator, starts showing congestion well before the Low capacity simulator, but can still be used to support cities of arbitrary size. As a test, the Classic capacity simulator was used to develop a city from scratch to a total of 4.129 million Sims. This city ran fine, with a mayor rating of 99, which is the same mayor rating that all the other capacity simulators produced. With different zoning, the Classic capacity simulator could easily have supported at least 5 million Sims in a healthy city. At these population levels with the low capacity simulators, though, there is massive congestion. With improved pathfinding, Sims make much better use of all transportation modes, especially with the Classic and Low capacity simulators. Specifically, usage of light rail (which includes el rail and ground light rail (GLR), or trams) used to be unreasonably low, right up to the previous version of the traffic simulator. With well-built light rail systems, usage is now much higher, often by two orders of magnitude. Lesser improvements also occur in the usage of other forms of rapid transit. The end result is that rapid transit of all types now has usage patterns much closer to the theoretically ideal ones. Version 3.0 of the NAM Traffic Simulator provides the first significant improvement in intercity traffic since early versions of Simulator Z. This improvement is most pronounced in the Classic and Low capacity simulators. Both versions of the CvS curve provide a significant traffic spreading effect, which is the result of the simulator rerouting traffic to avoid congestion. This effect is strongest in the Classic and Low capacity versions of the simulator due to their more powerful CvS curve. In addition to reducing congestion, this phenomenon also has a couple of other beneficial effects. In areas with a lot of commercial services, the spreading out of traffic means that more traffic passes by commercial services, which increases the number of customers for them, which in turn increases their desirability. In residential areas, the spreading out of traffic means that networks have lower average levels of traffic, which results in lower average traffic noise, which in turn results in higher desirability for the residences. The inverse of these effects does not happen (i.e., customer traffic is not lowered in previously congested areas when the congestion drops and traffic noise does not increase enough to make a difference when traffic spreads out to previously unused networks) due to the way the simulator is tuned. Due to the improvements in the pathfinder, abandonment due to commute time is even rarer than before in all capacity levels of the simulator. In the rare cases where it does occur, it tends to be minor, and tends to represent gaps in the city\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure, generally in the Education and Health areas. Looking at the Data Views for these sectors will typically show a deficit in one of these sectors in the area of abandonment, and building structures of the appropriate type in these areas should fix the problem. The maximum number of high wealth Sims that can live in a given city has increased substantially. Cities will see this increase only if they are well built and have the infrastructure to support a large number of high wealth Sims. Nevertheless, this change, which is also an effect of pathfinder optimization, gives the player options for city building that were not available before. Usage of well-built transit stations tends to be better, as the improved pathfinder is better at navigating its way through them. As the pathfinder improves, it is more sensitive to user actions in city construction. For example, if you want your Sims to use more mass transit, simply build more mass transit stations (and routes, if necessary). If you want your Sims to use your highways more, build more interchanges between your highways and other roadways. In these two cases, stations and interchanges may have to be placed closer together than in real life for maximum benefit, as the underlying mechanisms by which the game works are rather different from real life. For example, Sims try to take the fastest route in general, even if this means that they save only a few seconds in their commute. Normal real life constraints don\u0026rsquo;t apply to them, as they never have to wait for buses or trains to arrive, they never have to stop at intermediate stations, and they don\u0026rsquo;t even have to stop at stoplights. Sims are constantly on the move from the time they leave their homes until the time they arrive at their jobs. This results in a rather different commuting environment from what we are used to. Note that there is no \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; spacing of stations, bus stops, or highway interchanges; the best spacing depends on what usage patterns you want for your networks. Also, it\u0026rsquo;s important to know that Sims will walk arbitrarily far if necessary. The traffic simulator works most optimally in cities that have a reasonable number of streets, especially residential streets. Since this is how real life cities are built, this is just another way of saying that the traffic simulator works best in well built cities. Streets don\u0026rsquo;t have to comprise a majority of the roadways in the city; they just shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be rare. If you get a warning from the transportation advisor about not having enough streets, it is best to heed it. Other changes in the NAM Traffic Simulator from previous traffic simulators dating before 2011 (as well as from the original Maxis traffic simulator) include the following: # More realistic subway costs. Subways in Sim City are tremendously underpriced compared to the real world. The improvements to the pathfinder have made huge networks of subways less necessary, so the monthly cost for subway tiles has been multiplied by four to add a little more realism. More realistic air pollution due to traffic. Until now, the amount of air pollution emitted by traffic has been unchanged from the original game, where it was based on cities that had far less traffic capacity than that used by any of the recent traffic simulators. To keep the amount of air pollution emitted by traffic to a more realistic amount, the proportion of traffic air pollution to actual traffic has been lowered in the NAM Traffic Simulator. This lower proportion is linked to the Clean Air Act, so it is in effect only when the Clean Air Act is enabled. More accurate numbers for the Commute Time Graph. Due to a bug in the game, it is impossible to get accurate Commute Time Graph numbers for almost all situations. However, the NAM Traffic Simulator has adjusted the scaling of this graph to provide more accurate numbers for most situations. Improved intersection effects. Despite the appearance of stoplights at intersections, Sims don\u0026rsquo;t actually stop; they don\u0026rsquo;t even slow down unless congestion is present around the intersection. The NAM Traffic Simulator provides much more congestion around heavily-traveled intersections, thereby doing a better job of simulating stop lights and stop signs. These intersection effects also significantly aid the pathfinder in finding optimal routes; as mentioned above, congestion always makes the pathfinder work better. This particular feature may result in unexpected congestion showing up at intersections in the Congestion Traffic Data View. As this congestion is integral to the working of the pathfinder, it should be ignored by the player, other than to recognize where heavily used intersections exist. The transportation advisor may complain about these, but since he hasn\u0026rsquo;t done his homework and doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand how the NAM works, he should be ignored in this case. Greater Monorail and High Speed Rail (HSR) usage. Due to poor tuning of the original Maxis Traffic Simulator, Monorail and HSR usage was generally less than it should be, sometimes by quite a bit. The NAM Traffic Simulator compensates for this with improved pathfinding, which raises monorail and HSR usage to more appropriate levels. Monorail and High Speed Rail trains have been fixed to contribute to and be affected by traffic congestion, just like all other vehicles. This is essential for the pathfinder to work optimally. However, it also means that Monorail and High Speed Rail trains now contribute to vehicle air pollution. The Clean Air Act, mentioned in the second point above, helps compensate for this additional pollution. Greater highway usage. The traffic simulator has been tuned so that Sims use highways much more than ever before. This usage still tends to fall short of real world usage, though, due to the structure of the game. The amount of rapid transit available in a city will also have a big effect on highway usage. All mass transit speeds have been recalibrated to provide a more realistic simulation. Improved customer levels for businesses. Capacities and speeds of one-way roads have been raised to duplicate the real-world advantage of these roads. Street capacities have been raised so that they reflect the capacities implied by their speed limits. Simulator Versions # What are the different versions of the NAM Traffic Simulator, and how are they used? # The NAM Traffic Simulator comes in five capacity versions - Classic, Low, Medium, High, and Ultra. The name of the version refers to the network capacities in the simulator. The name \u0026ldquo;Classic\u0026rdquo; refers to the fact that the capacities are similar to those used in the original Maxis traffic simulator. The following is a list of the network capacities for each version of the simulator; all capacities are per tile (for two-tile networks such as the Avenue and Highways, multiply the value by 2):
Network Classic Low Medium High Ultra Street: 750 1500 2400 3600 7200 Road: 1200 2400 4000 6000 12000 Avenue: 1200 2400 4000 6000 12000 One-Way Road: 1800 3600 6000 9000 18000 Highway (Ground and Elevated): 3750 7500 12500 18750 37500 RealHighway: 3000 6000 10000 15000 30000 Subway/Elevated Rail/Ground Light Rail: 5000 10000 16000 30000 65200 Monorail/High Speed Rail: 5000 10000 16000 30000 65200 Rail: 5000 10000 16000 30000 65200 All versions of the NAM Traffic Simulator use the same speed settings for the various networks, as shown below:
Vehicle Type Street Road Avenue One-Way Road Maxis Highway RealHighway Car 30 50 50 75 150 150 Bus 25 45 45 65 150 150 Freight Truck 25 40 45 60 130 130 Pedestrian 15 15 15 15 0 10 Vehicle Type Rail Passenger Train 140 Freight Train 105 Vehicle Type Ground/Elevated Light Rail/Subway Light Rail Train/Tram 115 Vehicle Type Monorail/High Speed Rail Monorail/High Speed Rail Train 225 Which simulator version is appropriate for a particular city depends primarily on three things: the population of the city, the amount of rapid transit (rails) available, and the type of simulator used. Less capacity is needed for lower population cities, but less capacity is also required for cities with a lot of rapid transit. Finally, as mentioned above, the Classic and Low capacity simulators use the best pathfinder, and will therefore give the best simulation results if they can be used. So pick a simulator version based on these three factors; if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be the right capacity, you can always switch it out for a different capacity version by rerunning the NAM installer. Experience has shown that in large cities, the effects of such a switch may take up to five years to fully manifest. You can tell when things have stabilized by looking at the Traffic Volume Graph in the following way: First, let the game run until there is a sudden shift in traffic patterns. Sometimes, this may take over a year. Then run the game until you go at least a full year without any sudden change in traffic patterns. At that point, the transition to the new capacity simulator is complete. All this can be done without any harmful effects to your city.
What happened to the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT)? # [Note: If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT) is, or if you don\u0026rsquo;t use it, you can skip this section.]
With the introduction of the new traffic simulator, the TSCT is simply no longer needed to tune the simulator. There are two reasons for this: First, the past year of working with the simulator continually emphasized that many properties affect the simulation as a whole, and not just the function that is documented for them. This means that many properties in the TSCT that were thought to be safe to modify actually are not, and modifying them will almost always degrade the performance of the simulator. Second, with the significant improvement in simulator pathfinding, some properties of the simulator have become self-tuning, and this makes the settings for them in the TSCT unnecessary.
Here is the disposition of the various fields in the TSCT, starting in the upper left:
Mass Transit Usage: This field is now always set to the Medium value; the actual wealth and transit distributions can be seen int the greyed-out boxes on the right, in the box labeled \u0026ldquo;Custom\u0026rdquo;. However, the label \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo; no longer applies to these values, as the increased flexibility of the new simulator allows the player to set the balance between car and mass transit simply by the way they build their transit systems. A city with lots of highways but little mass transit will encourage car usage, while a city with with lots of mass transit and few or no highways will encourage mass transit usage. Highway Bus Lanes: Contrary to the description of this field, checking its box does not increase bus usage. In fact, it degraded simulator performance slightly. Park \u0026amp; Ride: This is discussed in its own section below. Buses contribute to traffic: This property is always set in the simulator, as it is necessary for optimal operation of the pathfinder. Monthly Fares per Sim per Tile: For people who really want to modify these values, they can safely be changed in the same way that the Park and Ride feature can be changed, as described below. Monthly Costs per Network Tile: As with the previous property, these values can safely be changed in the same way that the Park and Ride feature can be changed. Network Traffic Capacities: These are now fixed in the five capacity levels listed in the table above. Choosing different capacities degrades the performance of the traffic simulator. Base Network Capacity: This is set when the NAM is installed. To change it, you need to run the NAM installer again. Customers/Traffic Noise Coefficient: This is set to the optimal value for each simulator capacity and should not be changed. Commute Time Graph Scaling Factor: This is set to its optimal value and should not be changed. Commute Trip Max Time: This is set to the optimal value for each simulator capacity and should not be changed. Network Capacity Multiplier: This field is obsolete, as only the five listed capacities are supported. Intersection Effect Multiplier: This is set to its optimal value and should not be changed. Vehicle Air Pollution: Changing the value of this field is no longer supported. Data View: For now, customization of these data views is no longer supported. Eventually, they should be supported in the NAM installer. Park \u0026amp; Ride # Park \u0026amp; Ride is an option that was only supported in the TSCT. Park and Ride changes the game slightly so that cars cannot reach their destination directly. Instead, those Sims who prefer to drive must park near some sort of mass transit station and then take mass transit to the stop closest to their workplace. From there, they must walk the rest of the way. For this to work well, you need to have an extensive mass transit system. You also need to build parking lots and/or parking garages near key mass transit stops; generally the best places are at the edges of your residential areas that are closest to your jobs. Or you could just build parking facilities near the Sims\u0026rsquo; jobs (the ones that come with buildings generally don\u0026rsquo;t count), but this really defeats the main purpose of Park and Ride.
The ability to enable the Park \u0026amp; Ride functionality will eventually be incorporated into the NAM installer. Until then, this feature can be enabled only by modifying the traffic simulator file directly. This can be done with Ilive\u0026rsquo;s Reader (0.9.3); you can find the manual for the Reader here. For basic operations, the Reader is easy to use.
To turn on the Park \u0026amp; Ride feature of the traffic simulator, open the Reader and click the Open button. Navigate to the folder containing your traffic simulator and select it. If only the \u0026ldquo;Name\u0026rdquo; column appears in the right pane, you will have to click on the first \u0026ldquo;Exemplar file\u0026rdquo; row in the left pane to make all the other columns in the right pane visible.
Next, you will have to edit the \u0026ldquo;Travel type can reach destination\u0026rdquo; property, which is about two thirds of the way down in the right pane. Double click on this property name, and a list of values will come up. The second one applies to cars; its value is 0x01. Click on this value, type a zero, and then hit Enter twice. The list of values should disappear and the second value for this property in the right pane should have changed from True to False. If it has, type Control-S to save your new simulator. Park and Ride is now enabled.
To disable Park \u0026amp; Ride, follow the same steps as above, except that in the list of values that pops up, the second value will be 0x00, and you need to change it to a one. Once you do that, thesecond value for the \u0026ldquo;Travel type can reach destination\u0026rdquo; property in the right pane should have changed from False to True. You can now save the simulator and exit.
The Monthly Fares per Sim per Tile and the Monthly Costs per Network Tile can be modified in a similar fashion; the first one of these is named \u0026ldquo;Income per tile by travel type\u0026rdquo; in the simulator. Note that when you select a property in the reader, some helpful information about that property is displayed in the little window at the bottom.
These three properties are the only ones in the traffic simulator that are safe to modify. Modifying other properties, especially those that interact with the pathfinder, will almost always degrade the performance of the traffic simulator. The NAM Team cannot support installations where properties other than the three described above have been modified.
