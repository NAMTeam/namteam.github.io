Rather than the seven shades of blue in the original, this version uses the full spectrum of color, including approximately 48 distinct color shades. The maximum volume shown for each travel type has been increased from a flat 1200 for all types in the original Traffic Volume View to a value which is 300% of the capacity of the underlying network for the selected travel type.</description></item><item><title>Flexible Underpasses</title><link>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/flexible-underpasses/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/flexible-underpasses/</guid><description>New Method: Subway-based Draggable Override Network # The newest method for building Flexible Underpasses (FLUPs) involves the use of overrideable FLEX-based Portals, coupled with Subway-based draggable override networks, and overrideable FLEX-based overcrossing pieces. The new method currently supports tunnel portals for four networks in the RealHighway (RHW) plugin: the RHW-2, RHW-3, RHW-4, and the MIS Ramp.
The menu button used to access the Subway-based FLUPs content is located under the Highways menu, and it contains the items listed below:</description></item><item><title>High Speed Rail</title><link>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/high-speed-rail/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/high-speed-rail/</guid><description>This documentation has not yet been written.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Railway</title><link>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/hybrid-railway/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/hybrid-railway/</guid><description>The Hybrid Railway, or HRW is an intermediate FLEX based network that provides for both heavy and High Speed (Monorail) traffic. Specifications of the HRW include catenaries, textures that are the same as the RRW, as well as including some purpose-built textures for specific pieces.
In terms of functionality, the HRW handles both Heavy Rail (in orange) and Monorail as shown (in dark blue) below.
The HRW is a FLEX network utilising dual-networking (Rail and Monorail) pieces meaning it can only be constructed with FLEX pieces provided in the menus.</description></item><item><title>Light Rail/Tram</title><link>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/light-rail-tram/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/light-rail-tram/</guid><description>This documentation has not yet been written.</description></item></channel></rss>
