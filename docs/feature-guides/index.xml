SimCity 4&amp;rsquo;s automata are only a visual approximation of what is happening in the underlying traffic simulation, and maintain only a loose correlation to the actual statistical measures of the simulation. As such, any of the changes made to the Automata settings do not actually change any functional aspects of a network&amp;rsquo;s capacity, speed, or commute attributes.</description></item><item><title>Base Network Additions</title><link>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/base-network-additions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/base-network-additions/</guid><description>The documentation on this page may be out of date. The contents of this document may reference older, obsolete NAM content. However, it can still be used as a reference guide. Some additional features, such as the RealHighways (RHW), Network Widening Mod (NWM), RealRailways (RRW), High Speed Rail Project (HSRP), Turn Lanes, and PedMalls are covered in the Feature Guides section of this documentation.
Additional Overpasses # Many fully functional overpasses are included to allow Road, One-Way Road, and Avenues to cross over a variety of networks at different heights.</description></item><item><title>Bridges</title><link>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/bridges/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/bridges/</guid><description>This documentation has not yet been written.</description></item><item><title>Canals (CAN-AM)</title><link>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/canals/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/canals/</guid><description>This documentation covers legacy content. This component of the Network Addon Mod has not been updated in some time. Active development is likely to resume in the future. Overview # The CAN-AM is designed to work with either the CAL SG Canals by callagrafx (recommended) or the original SG Canals by SimGoober. Both of these are available in the SC4D LEX Legacy - BSC Canals Collection. This package also includes additional passenger and freight stations.</description></item><item><title>Cosmetic Additions</title><link>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/cosmetic-additions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/cosmetic-additions/</guid><description>This documentation has not yet been written.</description></item><item><title>Data View Plugins</title><link>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/data-view-plugins/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/data-view-plugins/</guid><description>Information # This Traffic Volume View offers a number of improvements to the one included with the game. Rather than the seven shades of blue in the original, this version uses the full spectrum of color, including approximately 48 distinct color shades. The maximum volume shown for each travel type has been increased from a flat 1200 for all types in the original Traffic Volume View to a value which is 300% of the capacity of the underlying network for the selected travel type.</description></item><item><title>Flexible Underpasses (FLUPs)</title><link>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/flexible-underpasses/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/flexible-underpasses/</guid><description>New Method: Subway-based Draggable Override Network # The newest method for building Flexible Underpasses (FLUPs) involves the use of overrideable FLEX-based Portals, coupled with Subway-based draggable override networks, and overrideable FLEX-based overcrossing pieces. The new method currently supports tunnel portals for four networks in the RealHighway (RHW) plugin: the RHW-2, RHW-3, RHW-4, and the MIS Ramp.
The menu button used to access the Subway-based FLUPs content is located under the Highways menu, and it contains the items listed below:</description></item><item><title>High Speed Rail</title><link>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/high-speed-rail/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/high-speed-rail/</guid><description>This documentation covers legacy content. This component of the Network Addon Mod has not been updated in some time. Active development is likely to resume in the future. Overview # In the early years of SC4, new technology was found by smoncrie which allowed the use a single puzzle piece to create a starter for a new set of textures or models for the same network. The original version of the HSRP replaces the Monorail network and was created by 3ddz and founded by Murakamon on the 24th of February 2006.</description></item><item><title>Hole Diggers and Raisers</title><link>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/hole-diggers-and-raisers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/hole-diggers-and-raisers/</guid><description>Overview # The Hole Diggers and Raisers provided in the NAM are a tool used to raise or lower a single tile of terrain by a precise amount, allowing for fine control over terraforming. This can be particularly useful when dealing with elevated networks (and especially with On-Slope Transitions), and building tunnels and bridges. The Hole Diggers and Raisers can be found near the top of the Highways menu, as well as the the Roads, Rails, and Miscellaneous Transportation menus.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Railway</title><link>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/hybrid-railway/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/feature-guides/hybrid-railway/</guid><description>The Hybrid Railway, or HRW is an intermediate FLEX based network that provides for both heavy and High Speed (Monorail) traffic. Specifications of the HRW include catenaries, textures that are the same as the RRW, as well as including some purpose-built textures for specific pieces.
In terms of functionality, the HRW handles both Heavy Rail (in orange) and Monorail as shown (in dark blue) below.
The HRW is a FLEX network utilising dual-networking (Rail and Monorail) pieces meaning it can only be constructed with FLEX pieces provided in the menus.</description></item></channel></rss>
