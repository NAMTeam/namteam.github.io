This documentation was last updated with an old version of the NAM. It is in the process of being rewritten. While it is mainly intended for persons with the skills to open the NAM&amp;rsquo;s associated file(s), it contains important information about the game. Therefore the following information aims at the more technical side of things and should only be considered as an additional source of information about the mods&amp;rsquo; files &amp;amp;/or game.</description></item><item><title>Credits</title><link>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/reference/credits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 10:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sc4nam.com/docs/reference/credits/</guid><description>The following named members of Simtropolis, SC4 Devotion, SimCityPlaza, and the SC4 Devotion Discord have, for whatever particular reason, been specifically included here for their special contributions during the NAM&amp;rsquo;s history.
