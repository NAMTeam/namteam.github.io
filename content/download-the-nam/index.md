# Wait, there's _two_ versions of the NAM?

Yes. There is the full **NAM** which includes all bugfixes, features, and new networks, and the **NAM Lite**, which is a small subset of the NAM, including all bugfixes and a much smaller set of features. The NAMLite is a bite-sized package for users looking for a minimal install. Think of NAMLite as a small collection of the NAM's "best hits".

If you're a brand new user, the sheer amount of content in the NAM can be overwhelming, so it could be a good idea to start out with NAM Lite to get a feel for how things work. Similarly if you are a user who prefers to play Simcity 4 as vanilla as possible, NAM Lite may also be a great option for you.
