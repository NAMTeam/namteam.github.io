title : "Network Widening Mod"
description: ""
lead: "The Network Widening Mod adds 13 new override networks, which extend the game's base Road and One-Way Road networks by providing different width variants, many with higher capacities. This includes 6 single-tile, 5 dual-tile, and 2 triple-tile override networks. Among these networks are the Turning Lane Avenues (TLA), which feature a center turn lane/flush median, multi-lane variants of the Road network, and four additional widths of the One-Way Road (OWR) network. It also includes some degree of diagonal functionality for all networks, transitions to connect NWM networks to Maxis networks or other NAM override networks, a series of Wide-Radius Curve pieces for three of the single-tile networks, and neighbor connector puzzle pieces for selected networks."
