<u>Hybrid Railway FLEX Switches.</u>

There are a few switch options for the Hybrid Railway system that consist of a few FLEX-piece items that can be used to make a variety of layout combinations. Apart from the FA-2 short FLEX Switch piece, these are partially static due to the mechanics of the codebase.

<u>Hybrid Railway Elevated Content</u>

The Hybird Railway has orthogonal and diagonal L1 sections or sections elevated to 7.5m. Only straights can be elevated.Curves and swiches will remain at Ground level.

<br>
Stub to Stub crossing
construction method<br>

The Hybrid Railway currently support L1 or 7.5m elevation for Straights (Orthogonal and diagonal) as well as crossings that are initated with the stub to stub (STS) method of crossings.

The STS method is very important for the construction of crosssings for the Hybrid Railway. Since the Hybrid Railway is a multi-tile network in itself, the HRW crossings neet to use the Stub to Stub or STS method of making a crossing.

Demonstation below.

Crossing support.

The
Hybrid Railway supports a large amout but no all crossings in the
Network Addon Mod (NAM). Orthogonal crossing orthogonal has a large
coverage in additions to other configurations.However, except HRW X HRW
configurations all require the stub to stub method to complete the
crossings . The table shown
below is the supported crossing as of the current Network Addon Mod
Version .<br>

In addition, the HRW has a few station options for both utilizing heavy rail and monorail/HSR traffic.

These have been provided by _"Tyberius06"_ and _"ulisse99"_

| ![](T_Station-Icons.jpg) | Various Stations to accompany the Hybrid Railway Mod. These stations are highlighted by the icons shown on the left. |
| ![](U_Station-Icons.jpg) |

<br>

In most situations the monorail tool will need to be drawn through the station to make the connection to the Hybrid Railway.
For the Station to function for the HRW with both Heavy Rail and High
Speed/Monorail Traffic, the station needs to use the monorail. If the
station just uses Heavy rail then the Heavy Rail tool gets used .<br>

<br>

| Conncting a station to the Hybrid Railway (Images by _"ulisse99")_ |

The
HRW network can have both Heavy Rail and High Speed/Monorail Traffic so
existing stations in a given city can be used with the Hybrid Railway. They will only support Heavy Rail traffic however.<br>

<br>
There is one draw way of making or converting segments of the RRW to HRW specification as shown below.<br>
<br>

| ![](FLEX%201.jpg) |
| 1) Draw out an Orthogonal or Diagonal segment of Railway.Note: This only works with straight sections of the Real Railway. |
| ![](FLEX%202.jpg) |
| 2)click on each Rail section with the monorail tool. |
| ![](FLEX%203.jpg) |
| 3)After progressively clicking the RRW will be converted to the HRW as defined by the overhead wires and poles. |

| ![](FLEX%20HT%201.jpg) |
| Additionally, the height of the HRW L1 is the same as the L1 ERRW.Note: The RRW flex OST is NOT compatible with the monorail network. An onslope can be used from the Elevated HRW menu |
| ![](FLEX%20HT%202.jpg) |
| With straight sections of L1 the RRW can be overclicked on the Real Railway
to make HRW L1. An over riding tile is needed to make this function. |
