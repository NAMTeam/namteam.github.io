  ## First Time Installation

  1. Verify your Sim City 4 version compatibility and minimum system specifications from the tables [below](#version-compatibility)</a>.

  2. [Download the NAM Installer](/download-the-nam) and unzip the file.

  3. Install the pre-packaged Java Runtime Environment if Java is not already installed. This is found under a file named **OpenJDKxxxx**.

  4. Run the <b>NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version{{< param docsversion >}}.jar</b> file.

  5. Follow the installer's instructions, clicking on each tab on the top bar -- in order!
      1. Read and agree to the mod's terms on the initial "welcome" tab.
      2. Select the options you would like to install under the "files" tab.
      3. Select the install location under the "location" tab.  This is typically left unchanged from the default Plugins folder.
      4. Finally, move to the "install" tab.  Click the "Start installation" button to begin the installation process.  When the installation is complete, the progress screen will display a message, "All selected components installed!".
      5. Close the installer. You're all done installing.
  
  6. **Additional step for Windows/Linux users (not required on macOS)**: apply the 4GB Patch.
      1. **<span style="color:red">Failure to apply this patch will highly probably result in the game crashing</span>**.
      2. Open the enclosed **4gb_patch.exe** file in the NAM download (or download it from [NTCore](https://ntcore.com/4gb-patch/)). A window will appear asking you to choose a file. Navigate to your game's installation location and select **SimCity 4.exe**. The location of this executable will vary. The default locations for common versions are:
          - **Steam**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SimCity 4 Deluxe\Apps`
          - **GOG**: `C:\GOG Games\SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition\Apps`
          - **EA App**: `C:\Program Files\EA Games\SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition\Apps`
          - **Original Disc Copy**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Maxis\SimCity 4 Deluxe\Apps`
      3. Upon completion, a message will pop up indicating whether or not the patch successfully applied.
          - Note that attempting to run the 4GB Patch file while still inside the download .zip may cause it to fail.
          - See [this segment of Haljackey's NAM installation video](https://youtu.be/mnuamQac9d0?si=ba1AAeRbTFuXLAIX&t=205) for a demonstration of the process. While this video was filed with NAM 46, the process of installing the 4GB Patch has not changed.
          - The batch file that was previously included in past recent NAM releases to assist with the 4GB Patch process is no longer included as of NAM 49, after the late 2024 incident where a hacker modified the NAM 48 download on ModDB to insert malware.
          - It is also possible to launch the 4GB Patch from a command line. Simply drop the *4gb_patch.exe* file into the same folder as your game's executable, and from the command line, type `4gb_patch.exe SimCity 4.exe`.

  7. **Additional step required for Mac users (optional on Windows/Linux)**: run [JDatPacker](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/30-gameplay-utilities/19-jdatpacker) to consolidate the mod's files.
      * If on the App Store version, run JDatPacker over the resultant Plugins directory, then move the "Network Addon Mod_###.dat" files (where "###" is a three-digit number) into the container.
      * On the Steam version (or if optionally using JDatPacker on Windows), run JDatPacker on the Documents\SimCity 4\Plugins directory (this will also consolidate your other plugins as well).  Make sure you remove the original directories that were consolidated, and, if upgrading or reinstalling your NAM package at any point, ensure you delete any the "Network Addon Mod_###.dat" files from your Plugins before running the new installation.  It is recommended that you use a new subfolder (i.e. "Plugins\Compressed Files") instead of installing to the root of the Plugins directory, as this can help prevent mod conflicts.
    
  8. Load the game and enjoy the NAM!

  {{< tab tabName="As an upgrade from a previous version" >}}
  ## Upgrading From a Previous Version

  1) Move your current NetworkAddonMod folder from your Plugins folder. Do not delete. Your Desktop is a decent place to move it for now. If you have consolidated your NAM files using a tool such as SC4DatPacker or JDatPacker, move the consolidated file instead.

  2) Run the NAM Installer for the new version.

  3) Run SimCity4 and test. If you have any issues or wish to revert, simply delete the new "NetworkAddonMod" folder in Plugins and replace with your previously moved folder to restore original functionality. Contact us for more help, if required.
