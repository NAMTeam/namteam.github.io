lead: "The Network Addon Mod (NAM) is designed to pave the way to new horizons in Sim City 4, quite literally. There are so many network options in this single mod that learning them can feel off-putting and overwhelming. Frankly, very few players will ever need all of them there's that many to choose from! 
Learning the basic principles of NAM, however, is easy. This page is the only part you need commit to memory!

# DRAGGABLE, PLOPPABLE!

Just like many other elements of Sim City 4, the many options in the NAM are used by either “dragging” or “plopping”. 

_Simply put: drag a highway, plop a junction!_ Seem familiar?

## OVERRIDES

There is one particular difference with the NAM from other mods and they are called **Overrides**. Many elements in the NAM are designed to be _plopped_ and then _dragged_ through. When this happens, they _transform_ their initial appearance, _updating and fitting_ itself into your design, _overiding_ into a single, seamless network. Knowing what Overrides to use in the right place is where you’ll spend the most time learning in-game. This is the fun part as there are literally _endless_ variations to choose from!

## IN-GAME MENU

Within NAM’s menu you’ll find the following icons/categories. We’ll get into where and when to use each tool later on, so for now all we need to learn are the differences between them:

* **PUZZLE PIECES** - A fixed, ploppable element that is static and **_does not_** override.
* **STARTER PIECES** - A ploppable element that **_does_** override, telling the game to ignore it’s default tool and use your chosen starter piece instead. Example, plop a single 4-lane highway starter piece down and then drag through it with the highway tool to build a 4-lane highway! Easy.
* **FLEX PIECES** - Another ploppable, pre-built element that **_does_** override. Example, you’ve built a highway but now you want to add a slip-road or ramp. Plop down a flex piece ramp directly on top and it’ll fit itself into your design just like that. Alternatively, drag though a piece and it’ll update. Flexible, wouldn’t you say?
* **HOLE/RAISER TOOL** - A simple tool that allows you to dig a hole (for tunnels) or raise the terrain (for bridges).
* **ERASER** - Unlike the standard in-game “Bulldozer” tool, the NAM’s Eraser allows minimal destruction! Erase one tile at a time. 
* **TRANSIT-ENABLED LOTS** - A piece that accepts more than one type of network. Example, a transit station, allowing sims to switch from riding a train to walking.


### USING THE MENU

Simply choose your category from the menu, then use **TAB** to cycle forwards (**SHIFT-TAB** for backwards) through the loop of various options within that category. A hovering preview shows you what’s available. A small dialog box above that explains what that piece is. Don’t worry if some of the descriptions don’t make sense just yet — this guide will help there.

**HOME** and **END** keys allow you to rotate the piece on the map, just like buildings.

(__Attention Steam Users__: The Steam Overlay is set to use the key combination **Shift-TAB** by default. Through the Steam client, you will need to either change the key combination for the overlay, or disable it altogether in order to use cycle backwards through TAB loops)
