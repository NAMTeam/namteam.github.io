# DRAGGABLE, PLOPPABLE!

Just like many other elements of Sim City 4, the many options in the NAM are used by either “dragging” or “plopping”.

_Simply put: drag a highway, plop a junction!_ Seem familiar?

## OVERRIDES

There is one particular difference with the NAM from other mods and they are called **Overrides**. Many elements in the NAM are designed to be _plopped_ and then _dragged_ through. When this happens, they _transform_ their initial appearance, _updating and fitting_ itself into your design, _overiding_ into a single, seamless network. Knowing what Overrides to use in the right place is where you’ll spend the most time learning in-game. This is the fun part as there are literally _endless_ variations to choose from!

## IN-GAME MENU

Within NAM’s menu you’ll find the following icons/categories. We’ll get into where and when to use each tool later on, so for now all we need to learn are the differences between them:

* **PUZZLE PIECES** - A fixed, ploppable element that is static and **_does not_** override.
* **STARTER PIECES** - A ploppable element that **_does_** override, telling the game to ignore it’s default tool and use your chosen starter piece instead. Example, plop a single 4-lane highway starter piece down and then drag through it with the highway tool to build a 4-lane highway! Easy.
* **FLEX PIECES** - Another ploppable, pre-built element that **_does_** override. Example, you’ve built a highway but now you want to add a slip-road or ramp. Plop down a flex piece ramp directly on top and it’ll fit itself into your design just like that. Alternatively, drag though a piece and it’ll update. Flexible, wouldn’t you say?
* **HOLE/RAISER TOOL** - A simple tool that allows you to dig a hole (for tunnels) or raise the terrain (for bridges).
* **ERASER** - Unlike the standard in-game “Bulldozer” tool, the NAM’s Eraser allows minimal destruction! Erase one tile at a time.
* **TRANSIT-ENABLED LOTS** - A piece that accepts more than one type of network. Example, a transit station, allowing sims to switch from riding a train to walking.

### USING THE MENU

Simply choose your category from the menu, then use **TAB** to cycle forwards (**SHIFT-TAB** for backwards) through the loop of various options within that category. A hovering preview shows you what’s available. A small dialog box above that explains what that piece is. Don’t worry if some of the descriptions don’t make sense just yet — this guide will help there.

**HOME** and **END** keys allow you to rotate the piece on the map, just like buildings.

(**Attention Steam Users**: The Steam Overlay is set to use the key combination **Shift-TAB** by default. Through the Steam client, you will need to either change the key combination for the overlay, or disable it altogether in order to use cycle backwards through TAB loops)
