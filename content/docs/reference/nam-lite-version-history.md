## Version 3 (27 March 2023)

* The Maxis RUL2 code has been restored.
* The FLEX Road Overpasses have been added to the Additional Network Features. These overpasses allow one to easily cross over railways and other surface streets with their Roads, One-Way Roads, and Avenues.

## Version 2 (15 January 2023) (SC4 20th Anniversary)

* NAM Lite is now offered as a separate download.
* Issues involving the Additional Maxis Highways feature have been addressed, including fixing functionality with Road and One-Way Road Perpendicular Interchanges with Elevated Highways, some of which affected users who did not install this option.
* Some features from the full edition of the NAM that were unintentionally accessible through NAM Lite menu buttons (in very broken forms) have been removed from the Perpendicular Interchanges and Avenue Roundabouts buttons.
* The Hole Digger and Ground Raiser items have been added to NAM Lite, as a strictly optional additional feature. They can be selected under "3 Additional Network Features".
