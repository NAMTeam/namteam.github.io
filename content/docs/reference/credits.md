## Special Thanks

Webmaster & administration staff at Simtropolis, SC4Evermore, ModDB, and SimCityPlaza.

All (other) members of original Simtropolis Modd Squad, especially the Modd Squad founders.

And possibly others who may not have been mentioned. If your name has been forgotten or you're not on the list, then drop us a line, as it has been difficult to keep track of anyone/everyone that may of helped somewhere along the lines.

And to the community itself, we would also like to thank you for your support, making mods such as this possible too. We're still at it after **18 years** thanks to you!

And last but not least, a thanks for the Maxis individuals too, for the [paid] work that they did. ;-)
