Thank you for downloading the **Network Addon Mod (NAM)** for SimCity 4 Deluxe (or SimCity 4 with Rush Hour Expansion). The NAM is a comprehensive transportation mod, adding the equivalent of multiple expansion packs worth of new transportation content to the game. In addition to fixes to the game's traffic simulation and base network features, it adds countless new features to the existing network tools, such as new overpasses, highway onramps, intersections, wider roadways, pedestrian malls, draggable ground light rail, roundabouts, and turning lanes, among many other features.

Please note that this documentation is still in a state of transition, and some links may refer to older but still largely relevant pieces of documentation.

The most recent version of this documentation may always be found at [https://www.sc4nam.com](https://www.sc4nam.com).

**This release is dedicated to CorinaMarie, Admin at Simtropolis (and co-author of our batch script)--we wish you the best in your recovery, and hope to see you back soon.**
