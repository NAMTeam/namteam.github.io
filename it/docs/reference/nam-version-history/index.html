id=version-47-27-march-2023>Version 47 (27 March 2023) <a href=#version-47-27-march-2023 class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Pedestrian Revolution Mod Features</strong>:<ul><li>The NAM Team is pleased to present the Classic Draggable Pedmalls, courtesy of <strong>Ulisse Wolf</strong> and <strong>Lucario Boricua</strong>. These come in 8 styles, 6 of which are equivalents to the Pedmall Puzzle Pieces, and introducing 2 new designs: the Retrowave Red Brick, inspired in the old brick texture used for the U-Rail in earlier NAM versions, and the Industrial Style, using the concrete surface typical of industrial lots. The initially supported features of these pedmalls include:<ul><li>Multidirectional draggable starter pieces using the Street network, supporting all orthogonal, diagonal, intersection and roundabout configurations, with the exception of wide radius curves.</li><li>Intersection support (OXO T and 4-way) in the form of mid-block crosswalks. These support Road, Avenue, and all two-way Network Widening Mod override networks (TLA-3, AVE-2, ARD-3, NRD-4, TLA-5, RD-4, RD-6, TLA-7 and AVE-6). These draggable pedmalls are also compatible with the FLEX mid-block crosswalk pieces.</li><li>Special underground paths enable residential zone development, while crossings discourage car traffic through restricted car paths.</li></ul></li><li>In addition, some enhancements to existing functionality have been implemented:<ul><li>The override code for the size 3 mid-block crosswalks for TLA-7 and AVE-6 have been overhauled, enabling these to be overridden from one side.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>RealHighway (RHW) Features</strong>:<ul><li><strong>RHW-12S</strong>: A new, 12-lane quadruple-tile RHW network (separable into two dual-tile halves, carrying 6 lanes in each direction) has been added, with the following features:<ul><li>Three height levels are supported: L0/Ground, L1/7.5-meter elevation, and L2/15-meter elevation. Transitioning between these height levels is supported by the ramp-style FLEX Height Transitions (FLEX-HT), as well as the FLEX OnSlope Transitions (FLEX-OSTs), by connecting them to the RHW-12S networks.</li><li>The RHW-12S features the same network crossings presently available to the other S-Type RHW networks, including crossings in all orientations for all Maxis base networks, all other RHW networks, Draggable Ground Light Rail, and Draggable Road Viaducts (L0-under-Viaduct-only), plus Orthogonal x Orthogonal (OxO)-only support for Network Widening Mod networks, Elevated RealRailway (ERRW) Viaducts, Tram-on-Street, Tram-in-Road, and Tram-in-Avenue. Limited Hybrid Railway (HRW) support also exists.</li><li>Extensive ramp interface support: supported ramps using FLEXRamps and Draggable Ramp Interfaces (when applicable) include Orthogonal Type A1 (all levels), Type B1 (all levels), Type D1 (all levels), Type E1 (all levels), Type A2 (all levels), Type B2 (L0 only), Type D2 (all levels), Type E2 (L0 only), Type A1-Inside (all levels), Type B1-Inside (all levels), Type D1-Inside (L0 only), Type E1-Inside (L0 only), the new Type A3 (L0 only) and Type D3 (L0 only), plus Diagonal Type A1 (L0 only), Type B1 (L0 only), Type D1 (L0 only), and Type E1 (L0 only).</li><li>FLEX Width Transition (FLEX-WT) has been added, to support width transitions between RHW-12S and RHW-10S at all applicable height levels.</li><li>FLEXFly over and undercrossings are supported with the RHW-12S (orthogonal-only, as diagonal undercrossings for FLEXFly do not presently exist for any network).</li><li>Several bridges have been added (see Bridge section).</li><li>Support for FlexSPUI is presently limited, and Three-Level Crossings are not yet supported.</li></ul></li><li><strong>RHW X3 Ramps</strong>: The first two FLEX 3-lane ramps, in A3 and D3 configurations, have been provided for RHW-8S, 10S and 12S. At present, only L0 support is available.</li><li><strong>General Improvements</strong><ul><li>Some enhancements, courtesy of <strong>memo</strong>, have been made to facilitate FLEXFly-over-FLEXFly functionality.</li><li>Some enhancements, courtesy of <strong>Flann</strong>, to elevated RHW network models have been added.</li><li>Various adjacencies involving RHW x RHW crossings next to the base orth-diag curve on the smaller networks (RHW-6S and smaller) have been addressed.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Bridges</strong>:<ul><li>A multitude of new bridges have been added, courtesy of <strong>IDS2</strong> and <strong>Kitsune</strong>:<ul><li>New viaduct bridges for L0 RHW-8S, L0 RHW-10S and L0-L2 RHW-12S.</li><li>A pair of new Steel Arch bridges for RHW-10S and RHW-12S.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Base Network Features</strong>:<ul><li>A new 5x5 90° Wide Radius Curve FLEX piece has been added to the Avenue network.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>:<ul><li>A huge number of bugfixes have been done for this release, including:<ul><li>Various RHW situations involving &ldquo;tile drops&rdquo;, such as the RHW-8S-to-6S FLEX Width Transitions, the RHW-8S Type D1, E1, and B2 ramps, and the RHW-10S Type D2 and E2 ramps, have received considerable stability upgrades.</li><li>The orientation of the Road end-T on OWR-1 intersection has been corrected.</li><li>The orientations of certain NWM intersections involving the OWR-1 network with Euro textures have been corrected.</li><li>Stability improvements have been made to the Ground Light Rail crossings with various wider RHW networks.</li><li>The Dual Type 230 QCXs with L1 Dual Type 230-over-RHW-8C/6C and RHW-10S/8S have been improved.</li><li>Issues in which lane drop arrows appeared in the wrong places on the S-to-C FLEX Width Transitions have been corrected.</li><li>The ramp textures for the RHW-10S Type D2 and E2 ramps, as well as for the RHW-8S Type A2-Wide and B2 ramps have been improved.</li><li>Orientation and stability issues have been fixed with the Avenue-based AVE-6 and its Thru-T-intersections with Street, Road, and One-Way Road (both Short-T and Long-T).</li><li>Orthogonal x Diagonal slip lanes involving Road and One-way Road (OWR) have been re-implemented.</li><li>Several hundred path files across all areas of the NAM have been fixed by <strong>memo</strong> and <strong>Tarkus</strong>.</li><li>More SAM Street crossings with the Rail network have received crossing gates.</li><li>Euro wealth textures have been added to the Avenue-based AVE-6 network.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=version-46-15-january-2023-sc4-20th-anniversary>Version 46 (15 January 2023) (SC4 20th Anniversary) <a href=#version-46-15-january-2023-sc4-20th-anniversary class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Network Widening Mod (NWM) Features</strong>:<ul><li>Support for diagonal 4-way (+) intersections and crossings has been added for all six single-tile NWM networks (TLA-3, AVE-2, ARD-3, OWR-1, OWR-3, and NRD-4), including orthogonal X diagonal (OXD), diagonal X orthogonal (DXO) and diagonal X diagonal (DXD). These networks may cross one another, along with all base Maxis networks, Ground Light Rail (GLR), and Single-Track Rail (STR). Support for 3-way intersections, other NAM network families (i.e. RHW, SAM, etc.), and those involving multi-tile NWM networks will be added in a future phase.</li><li>A preliminary version of an Avenue-based form of the 6-lane Avenue (AVE-6) network has been added, which supports full wealthing. To build an AVE-6 with the Avenue tool, overlap two orthogonal Avenues, and they will convert (diagonals are not presently supported). Most intersections supported by the existing AVE-6 are supported with this new implementation, and it is also possible to transition to the traditional Road-based AVE-6 for any functionality not yet supported.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Network Widening Mod (NWM) Features</strong>: Over 20 new Bridges have been added, courtesy of IDS2, including the first Bridges for the OWR-4 and OWR-5 networks (which are Avenue-based Bridges, due to the side-by-side Bridge limitation). Further bridge support has been added for RD-4, RD-6, SAM-6 (Klinker Streets), SAM-11 (MGB Industial), Double-Track Rail (DTR) and Single Track Rail (STR).</li><li><strong>Hybrid Railway (HRW) Features</strong>: L2 HRW support has been added, along with LHD improvements, and a reimplementation of the OnSlope Transitions to improve slope handling. Elevated support includes R2 elevated curves (at L1 and L2), orthogonal X orthogonal (OXO) crossings with the base road networks (Road, OWR, Avenue), the Network Widening Mod and the RealHighway, and diagonal X orthogonal (DXO) includes the base road networks and the RealHighway.</li><li><strong>Rail Slope Settings</strong>: An improved set of Rail Slope Settings has been prepared, providing more user choice and greater usability with the smoother/more restrictive options.</li><li><strong>Base Network Features</strong>:<ul><li>Courtesy of the recently-returned Shadow Assassin, the diagonal transitions between the Avenue network and the Road and RHW-2 networks have been dramatically improved, and extended versions have been added. Direct connection transitions were re-designed for a smoother look, and the new extended versions use a stub-to-stub override.</li><li>In preparation for future phases of the NWM diagonal intersection expansion, the base T-intersections involving diagonal Road and/or One-Way Road have been revamped.</li></ul></li><li><strong>RealHighway (RHW) Features</strong>:<ul><li>The long-awaited Dual Type 230 QuickChange Xpress Diamond Interchange setups are now available, which allow one to quickly build pre-fabricated interchanges between various RealHighway (RHW) networks and the triple-tile NWM networks, complete with turn lanes and all the bells and whistles.</li><li>The Diagonal Ramp-Style FLEX Height Transitions now support RHW-3 and RHW-6S.</li><li>The Double-Decker RHW-4 (DDRHW-4) models have been revamped, courtesy of Ulisse, coupled with some improvements to base functionality.</li><li>The Type E1-Inside ramps now have elevated forms, and various incremental improvements have been made to the elevated ramp interface models.</li><li>The Type A2 and B2 merging ramps have been re-designed to feature a lane drop prior to connecting with the mainline lanes.</li><li>A new FLEX Width Transition piece has been added, to better facilitate transitions involving multi-tile S-type networks (especially the previously unstable RHW-8S-to-6S transitions, with their tile drop).</li><li>The MIS 2-Lane FLEX Turn Lanes (including the FLEX Height Transition) can now connect smoothly to FlexSPUI and FlexDDI.</li></ul></li><li><strong>FLEX Turn Lane (FTL) Streetlights</strong>: The FLEX Turn Lane (FTL) setups (except the very limited Avenue Type 020) now support streetlights.</li><li><strong>New NAM Website</strong>: An official Network Addon Mod website has been launched, <a href=https://www.sc4nam.com>https://www.sc4nam.com</a>, featuring NAM documentation and feature guides.</li><li><strong>NAM Lite</strong>: NAM Lite has now been spun off as a standalone download.</li></ul><h2 id=version-45-8-september-2022>Version 45 (8 September 2022) <a href=#version-45-8-september-2022 class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Traffic Simulator Updates</strong>: The NAM Traffic Simulator has been upgraded to Simulator Z 3.0, resulting in further optimizations to both the speed and accuracy of the simulation, and improved network utilization. The Low capacity version of the simulator is now the recommended version, as it provides the most optimized simulation. The Traffic Volume View Plugins have also been updated. The Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT) has been discontinued and is no longer supported, as it was designed to work with the 2.x releases of Simulator Z, and because of the nature of the changes in the 3.0 release.</li><li><strong>Ploppable Interchanges for the RealHighway (RHW) System</strong>: The initial QuickChange Xpress (QCX) ploppable interchanges for the RHW have been incorporated, featuring 16 Road and Avenue Diamond Interchanges, which are FLEX-based, adding to their ease-of-use and post-plop customization potential. The QCX interchanges are at the end of the RHW QuickChange menu button on the Highways Menu.</li><li><strong>Pedestrian Revolution Mod (PRM) Midblock Crosswalks</strong>: The initial phase of the new Pedestrian Revolution Mod (PRM, or PedRev), spearheaded by developer <strong>Lucario Boricua</strong> has been added, featuring Midblock Crosswalk options for Roads, Avenues, and the two-way Network Widening Mod (NWM) override networks, in three sizes. These crosswalks calm traffic and allow for connections to the NAM&rsquo;s existing Pedestrian Mall (PedMall) features. The Midblock Crossings button can be found on the Roads Menu.</li><li><strong>NAMLite Package</strong>: The initial version of NAMLite, a bite-sized package for users looking for a minimal install has been added to the download, with its own installer. NAMLite Version 1 features the Traffic Simulator, Automata Controllers, bugfixes, One-Way Roads, Roundabouts, Diagonal Streets, and the option to install the Diagonal Street FLEX/Helper Pieces, Avenue Roundabouts, and Additional Highway Interchanges for the Maxis (Elevated) Highway and Ground Highway networks.</li><li><strong>Hybrid Railway (HRW) Features</strong>: L1 Diagonal support has been added, along with a number of new crossings.</li><li><strong>Left-Hand Driving (LHD) Improvements</strong>: The Left-Hand Driving (LHD) functionality of the NAM has been dramatically overhauled and improved, fixing numerous bugs and improving reliability for users playing the game with traffic running on the left side of roads and rails. Note that some RHW ramp interfaces and FLEX transitions may need to be reclicked as a result of their LHD reimplementation.</li><li><strong>Documentation Upgrades</strong>: The documentation has been thoroughly updated and now covers almost all NAM features to at least some extent, with the addition of feature guides for Hybrid Railway (HRW), the Pedestrian Revolution Mod, Ground Light Rail (GLR) and Tram Dual-Networking, the Elevated Road Viaducts, RealExpressway (REW), Utility Items (Network Eraser and Hole Diggers/Raisers), Underground Rail (URail), and the Canal Addon Mod (CAN-AM), alongside an updated glossary page.</li><li><strong>Euro Texture Optimization</strong>: As a result of the large-scale file cleanup effort undertaken following the release of NAM 44 (known as &ldquo;NAM 44X&rdquo;), the NAM&rsquo;s Euro textures largely operate independently, and no longer rely upon overrides of the default US texture set. This has decreased the size of a Euro Texture installation of the NAM by about 300MB, and along with other optimizations, has dropped the size of the NAM download package by about 150MB.</li><li><strong>New Bridges</strong>: A plethora of new bridges designed by <strong>IDS2</strong> have been added this release:<ul><li>Walnut Street (V-Shaped Girder) Bridges: Support for Road, Street, One-Way Road, SAM Sets 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, RHW-2, and RHW-4.</li><li>Antheor Viaduct (Brick Arch Viaduct) Bridges: Support for RealRailway (RRW) Dual-Track Rail (DTR) and Single-Track Rail (STR).</li><li>Additionally, the existing Cable-Stayed Bridge has been ported to cover Ground Light Rail (GLR).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Additional RealExpressway Ramps</strong>: New Road-to-OWR-1 splits have been added to the RealExpressway Mod, and can be found at the end of the RealExpressway Ramps button on the Roads Menu.
RHW MIS Ramp and FLEX Turn Lane Additions: L1 support for MIS 2-Lane FLEX Turn Lanes (FTLs) has been added, including a new combination upward height/width transition. Additionally, network support for the MIS 2-Lane FTLs has been improved, along with the ability to use the same draggable method used on the One-Way Roads (via transition to Road prior to an intersection) for SITAP (Signalized Intersection and Turn Arrow Project) support has been incorporated.

For PC users, any stations plopped in your cities from NAM 31 will automatically be upgraded when you install NAM 31.1.For Mac users, the replacement set of basic Maxis stations had to be modified, along with the Modern El Train Station by Brenda Xne. These fixes were necessary due to a bug in the Mac version of SC4. If you&rsquo;re a Mac user and you plopped any of these stations from the NAM using version 31, you will have to bulldoze them and replop them once you have installed NAM 31.1.</li><li>New Street network functionality: Some new draggable wide-radius curves, and intersections along wide-radius curves, are now possible with the Street network. Credit for this new feature goes to Swordmaster from the NAM Team.</li><li>RealHighway Filler Pieces have been restored and expanded after previous issues.</li><li>Installing over previous versions: NAM 31.1 may be installed directly over top of any previous NAM releases. It is a full release, not a patch or a hotfix. All future updates are planned to be in full package form, and there are no plans to issue patches or hotfixes in the future.

In order to build this intersection, draw the one-way road last and draw it only to/from the tile next to the road/avenue intersection</li><li>Made street intersections with road/avenue t-intersections easier. Draw the street last and draw it only to/from the tile next to the road/avenue intersection</li><li>Made it possible for a orth 1-way road to intersect with a diag road/ave t-intersection</li><li>Made it possible for a diag 1-way road to intersect with a orth road/ave t-intersection</li><li>Fixed a visual bug that caused traffic to drive on the wrong side of the road on a diag ave-diag ave T-intersection.</li><li>Fixed a bug that prevented U-turns on diagonal avenues that intersected or T-intersected with a diagonal road.</li><li>Fixed a bug that prevented U-turns on orthagonal avenues that intersected with a diagonal avenue.</li><li>Fixed a U-Drive-It bug for a ground rail intersection that previously did not allow you to switch the track while driving a train in U-Drive-It.</li><li>On Avenue intersections between a straight (orthogonal) avenue and a diagonal avenue, Sims coming from the diagonal avenue could not turn left onto the straight avenue. This is fixed.</li><li>The ability to dead end straight (orthogonal) roads or oneways into a diagonal avenue has been added. Thanks to Teirusu for the textures. Enjoy!</li><li>Diagonal T interchanges have improved graphics.</li><li>Sims could not drive straight through the road in a parallel road onramp to a ground highway when driving so the highway is on their right. This is fixed.</li><li>One of the bugs causing cars to jump to different ramps on diagonal T ground highway interchanges was fixed.</li><li>Avenue/oneway transitions now have custom graphics so they look better, textures compliments of Teirusu.</li><li>When entering a ferry terminal in U-Drive it, your mission could fail instead of being redirected back onto the road. This is fixed, thanks to Karybdis.</li><li>When driving over a ground level highway on an avenue overpass with onramps in the left lane, a U-Drive-it mission would fail. This is fixed.</li><li>U turns immediately bordering avenue onramps on an avenue crossing a ground level highway could not be used by people just leaving or about to enter the highway. This is fixed.</li><li>U turns immediately bordering avenue onramps on an avenue crossing an elevated highway could not be used by people just leaving or about to enter the highway. This is fixed.</li><li>Half of the time Sims went underneath a diagonal elevated highway on a road with onramps, they could not turn left on the onramp. This has been fixed in Rush Hour.</li><li>Half of the time Sims exited a diagonal elevated highway onto a diagonal road with offramps, they could not turn left on the road. This has been fixed in Rush Hour.</li><li>Added the ability to end diagonal Oneways in a T-intersection with a perpendicular diagonal avenue.</li><li>When Sims approached a diagonal avenue from a diagonal oneway, they could not turn left on the avenue. This is fixed.</li><li>When Sims were driving on a diagonal avenue, they could not make a U-turn at half of the intersections with a perpendicular oneway road. This is fixed.</li><li>Added the ability to end diagonal roads in a T-intersection with a perpendicular diagonal avenue.</li><li>Fixed another avenue/oneway transition bug. It should be out of beta now, and fully operational with no further issues.</li><li>Fixed avenue/oneway transitions so that U-Drive-it works in both lanes.</li><li>Transitioning avenues to one way roads without an intersection.</li><li>Previously, cars could not make some left turns onto a diagonal road when approaching from a straight one way road. This is now fixed.</li><li>In three way monorail junctions, you could not change the switch&rsquo;s direction. Driving the monorail over the switch would end your U-Drive-It mission instantly. This has been fixed.</li><li>3 Bugs fixed which prohibited cars from turning in various directions when a diagonal road crossed a straight avenue.</li><li>Avenues dead ending into streets were completely impassable by any form of transit.</li><li>Perpendicular road to one way intersections oriented on the diagonal did not allow left turns from the one way.</li><li>The rest of the perpendicular road to road intersections oriented on the diagonal were fixed. Sims could not turn left from one of the roads coming from either direction.</li><li>Updated some intersections between avenues and one way roads to show better automata.</li><li>Diagonal Avenues with grid aligned (non-diagonal) ground train tracks crossing the avenue would not allow any cars to pass.</li><li>A road to road diagonal T intersection was not allowing Sims to turn left onto one of the roads.</li><li>Continuing an avenue with one way streets from an avenue/one way intersection did not allow any cars to pass through the avenue/one way intersection.</li><li>Sims could not turn left at some diagonal avenues when approaching from a diagonal road.</li><li>Elevated rail lines crossing ground highways prevented cars from travelling on the ground highway below.</li><li>North or Southbound one way roads could not create T intersections with Westward avenues.</li><li>Some intersections between avenues and one way roads did not allow correct turns.</li><li>Avenues dead ending into one way roads did not allow any Sims to pass through the intersection.</li><li>On half of the perpendicular road to road intersections oriented on the diagonal, Sims could not turn left from one of the roads coming from either direction.</li></ul><div class="page-footer-meta d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-between"><div class="last-modified fs-6 fst-italic text-muted"><a href=https://github.com/NAMTeam/namteam.github.io/commit/7b62042045c4940a647eed90df86278faf7d7762 class=link-secondary target=_blank><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>Ultima modifica il luglio 14, 2025</a></div></div><div class="docs-navigation d-flex justify-content-between"><a href=/it/docs/reference/glossary/><div class="card my-1"><div class="card-body py-2">&larr; Glossario</div></div></a><a class=ms-auto href=/it/docs/reference/technical-information/><div class="card my-1"><div class="card-body py-2">Informazioni tecniche &rarr;</div></div></a></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer text-muted"><div class=container-fluid><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 order-last order-lg-first"><ul class=list-inline><li class=list-inline-item>Copyright (c) 2008-2024 NAM Team</li></ul></div><div class="col-lg-8 order-first order-lg-last text-lg-end"><ul class=list-inline></ul></div></div></div></footer><script src=/js/vendor/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.min.141d50112b4669a7bc085491b319a520d80917e90e7c2828cc9b99de3f735ae3755a8766dbecae4fb6ea298f0e5a82e0578db385845332db48fd73b0ccc97701.js integrity="sha512-FB1QEStGaae8CFSRsxmlINgJF+kOfCgozJuZ3j9zWuN1Wodm2+yuT7bqKY8OWoLgV42zhYRTMttI/XOwzMl3AQ==" crossorigin=anonymous defer></script>
