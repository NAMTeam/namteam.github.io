Most notably, NAM introduces hundreds of new network options, ranging from highways, railways, bridges, pedestrian malls and a lot more. Additionally, the mod greatly improves the game’s traffic simulator, bringing a whole new level of accuracy and performance.
Where do I start? # Right here, of course!
This page is the first step. This whole \u0026ldquo;Getting Started\u0026rdquo; section is the part of this website you need to read. In doing so, you\u0026rsquo;ll know the following about NAM:
What it is. What you need to install it What it\u0026rsquo;s basic functions are What it can do in-game. Notice there\u0026rsquo;s no indication of how to do something in that above list. That\u0026rsquo;s purposeful. That bit comes later.
For the other categories (Reference, Feature Guides etc) refer to them only as you need them.
So, wait, is there a steep learning curve? # Here\u0026rsquo;s the simple answer: yes and no. An untold amount of hours have gone into creating NAM, and many more in trying to make it as intuitive as possible. It cannot be ignored, however, that Sim City 4 is now a 20-year old game and balancing its hard code whilst providing the player with more realistic networks does mean there\u0026rsquo;s a learning curve. Fortunately, there\u0026rsquo;s only a few basic principles tying everything together and they can be found at the basics page. Before we get to that though\u0026hellip;
How do I install it? # To avoid running into issues in-game, it\u0026rsquo;s very important your computer is setup correctly. This includes three important steps:

Read more Choose from the following\u0026hellip; # First Time Installation First Time Installation # Double check for Sim City 4 version compatibility here Download and unzip the NAM Installer via the button at the top of this website. Install the pre-packaged Java Runtime Environment if not already installed. This is found under a file named \u0026ldquo;OpenJDKxxxx\u0026rdquo; Running the Installer\u0026hellip; On Windows: Use the file NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version47.bat. This will install a 4GB Patch that allows NAM to run properly in-game. On macOS: Run NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version47.jar. If on the App Store version, the installer cannot directly install into the Plugins location the App Store version utilizes, which is inside the .app file (~/Library/Containers/com.aspyr.simcity4.appstore/Data/Documents/SimCity 4). Install to an alternate location first, then copy the resultant \u0026ldquo;Plugins\u0026rdquo; folder into that location. Note that the NAM Team is currently very limited in our ability to provide installation assistance to App Store users. On Linux: Run NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version47.jar, or, if that fails, run NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version47.sh. Follow the installer\u0026rsquo;s instructions, clicking on each tab on the top bar \u0026ndash; in order! a) Agree to the mod\u0026rsquo;s terms on the initial \u0026ldquo;welcome\u0026rdquo; tab. b) Select the options you would like to install under the \u0026ldquo;files\u0026rdquo; tab. c) Select the install location under the \u0026ldquo;location\u0026rdquo; tab. This is typically left unchanged from he default Plugins folder. d) Finally, move to the \u0026ldquo;install\u0026rdquo; tab. Click the \u0026ldquo;Start installation\u0026rdquo; button to begin the installation process. When the installation is complete, the progress screen will display a message, \u0026ldquo;All selected components installed!\u0026rdquo;. e) Close the installer. You\u0026rsquo;re all done installing. 5a) Additional step for Mac users (optional on Windows/Linux): run JDatPacker to consolidate the mod\u0026rsquo;s files.
If on the App Store version, run JDatPacker over the resultant Plugins directory, then move the \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod_###.dat\u0026rdquo; files (wherein \u0026ldquo;###\u0026rdquo; is a three-digit number) into the container. On the Steam version (or if optionally using JDatPacker on Windows), run JDatPacker on the Documents\\SimCity 4\\Plugins directory (this will also consolidate your other plugins as well). Make sure you remove the original directories that were consolidated, and, if upgrading or reinstalling your NAM package at any point, ensure you delete any the \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod_###.dat\u0026rdquo; files from your Plugins before running the new installation. It is recommended that you use a new subfolder (i.e. \u0026ldquo;Plugins\\Compressed Files\u0026rdquo;) instead of installing to the root of the Plugins directory, as this can help prevent mod conflicts. Load the game and enjoy the NAM! Upgrading from a Previous Version Upgrading from a Previous Version # Move your current NetworkAddonMod folder from your Plugins folder. Do not delete. Your Desktop is a decent place to move it for now. Note: if you have consolidated your NAM files using a tool such as SC4DatPacker or JDatPacker, move the consolidated file. Run the NAM Installer for the new version. Run SimCity4 and test. If you have any issues or wish to revert, simply delete the new \u0026ldquo;NetworkAddonMod\u0026rdquo; folder in Plugins and replace with your previously moved folder to restore original functionality.

Notes
EA/Origin/Xbox Game Pass is not supported as these versions are unfortunately perma-locked to older versions of the game (Version 1.1.610). Technical support is limited for Mac Steam version users, and very limited for macOS Store version users._ Minimum Specs # NAM with a LowRAM/NoRHW Controller option: Any system built within the last 15 years, with 750MB available disk space. (Users running this option cannot install the RealHighway (RHW) features.) NAM with a Full 4GB Controller option: Any system with a 64-bit operating system, at least 4GB RAM, and 1.2GB available disk space. If on Windows, the 4GB Patch must be applied to the game\u0026rsquo;s executable. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting # What should I do if the NAM does not support my copy of the game? # The new NAM installer (introduced with the NAM 37 Release Candidate) no longer runs a version check. However, it is strongly recommended that users check the version they are running, as unpatched copies can be unstable. Version 1.1.610 and Version 1.1.613 are NOT supported.
In Case F, the solution is simply to install the EP1 Update 1 patch, which can be downloaded from EA (SKU 1-5), SimCity 4 Devotion (SKU 1-5), or Simtropolis (SKU 1 and 2 only). To determine the correct SKU version for your copy of SimCity 4, find the installation directory, and look in the subfolder named sku_data. Alternatively, one can simply try all the SKU versions of the patch, until one works.
For Case G and H, see the section about Origin below.
For Cases D and E, again note that the NAM Team has little experience with the Mac version of the game, mostly restricted to the Steam version, and may be very limited in any ability to provide platform-specific technical support, including with the installation process (which is more complex on the App Store version). See the section about macOS here.
For Cases G, H, I, and J, it is recommended that you purchase a digital copy of SimCity 4 Deluxe (NOT from Origin).
What if my disc copy has simply stopped working with Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, or 10?
In 2015, Microsoft decided that secdrv.sys, the driver file used by the SafeDisc and other disc copy protection systems present in many PC games from the early 2000s, was a security threat. As a result, the driver was not included as part of Windows 10, and Microsoft issued Windows Update KB3086255, which disables secdrv.sys on Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1. In the case of the older versions of Windows, secdrv.sys can be re-enabled when needed through the use of the command prompt or a batch file.
Aside from the advanced step of manually signing a device driver for Windows 10, the only viable courses of action are to either purchase a retail digital copy of the game, from a retailer who offers a fully-prepatched Version 1.1.641 copy of the game (i.e. GOG or Steam), or to get EA/Origin Customer Support to redeem your CD Key for a free digital copy of the game (unlike copies purchased via the Origin Store, the EA App, or EA Play subscriptions, CD Key Redemption copies are fully-prepatched to Version 1.1.641).
Note that cracked executables (i.e. a \u0026ldquo;No CD\u0026rdquo; .exe) are not eligible for tech support. The NAM Team does not support piracy, but understands the frustration with the game\u0026rsquo;s original DRM system being blocked by Microsoft, forcing one to buy a new digital copy in order to continue playing. However, the reason why cracked executables are not eligible is for more practical reasons, namely the potential for version mismatches (i.e. a Version 1.1.638 crack with Version 1.1.610/613 .DAT files, or vice-versa), which can greatly complicate the team\u0026rsquo;s efforts to provide useful technical support to users. The Origin issues played a role in our keeping the version check in place, until the recent installer change in 2020.
Please note that if you are attempting to use an older, 32-bit version of Windows (i.e. Windows XP) in order to still run your disc game, this will substantially hamper the performance of the game with the full NAM installed, and it is highly recommended that you run the game on a 64-bit operating system if you intend to take advantage of the full feature set. If you must run on a 32-bit OS, you will need to either install the new NAMLite package, or, for a mid-sized installation, select one of the \u0026ldquo;LowRAM/NoRHW\u0026rdquo; NAM Controller options. (The RealHighway (RHW) system is by far the largest part of the NAM.)
Notice to Users Who Purchased a Digital Copy from Origin, or Use EA Play or Xbox Game Pass # Aside from a brief period in 2014-2015, Origin and the EA App, the digital retail platforms run by Electronic Arts (EA), have been selling copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe featuring an unpatched and unpatchable version of the game\u0026rsquo;s executable file to retail customers. As of the release of NAM 47, this is still the case. Unlike the retail versions sold by GOG.com and Steam (and previously Amazon\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Thin Game Download\u0026rdquo; version), which come prepatched to Version 1.1.641, the edition sold on the Origin Store and the EA App (also used by the EA Play subscription service), features a Version 1.1.610 executable, mixed with Version 1.1.641 versions of the SimCity_1-5.dat files. By virtue of switching out the original SafeDisc copy protection for their own DRM, EA/Origin altered the checksum of the game\u0026rsquo;s executable, thereby preventing EA\u0026rsquo;s own EP1 Update 1 (Version 1.1.638) and BAT Nightlighting/EP1 Update 2 (Version 1.1.640) patchers from properly updating the executable. It also appears to be more difficult to apply the 4GB Patch with the EA App version, which is needed in order to run a full NAM installation.
This not only fails to meet the NAM\u0026rsquo;s minimum requirements, but leaves EA App/Origin retail copies with many stability issues developers fixed in 2003, and without working nightlighting on any custom buildings. It also prevents first-party content creation tools like the Building Architect Tool (BAT) from being installed, which look for a properly-patched executable. Note that this is in spite of the curious fact that EA uses images of the NAM and other pieces of custom content to advertise SimCity 4, both on EA.com and in the EA App.
Furthermore, the EA App and Origin client are capable of actually unpatching other versions of SimCity 4 Deluxe that a user may have installed on their system, including the Steam and GOG versions, via the \u0026ldquo;Repair\u0026rdquo; process. Even if you are not playing an EA App/Origin version of the game, be aware that the EA App and Origin client can still unpatch your game.
For those who have purchased the game via EA.com, the EA App, or the Origin Store, the NAM Team recommends you contact EA/Origin Support about obtaining a refund, even after the return period has expired, as users have had success in this case. If you are among the users who are saddled with the unpatched and unpatchable EA App/Origin retail version. The team would also appreciate hearing from you, as we have a strong desire to see EA give their customers a properly-patched copy of the game, and are trying to document just how many users are affected. Those playing via EA Play/Xbox Game Pass should also let EA Play know that they are serving up an outdated executable for the game, missing key stability fixes.
Strangely, copies obtained by redeeming an existing CD key at no cost with Origin Customer Support (Case C) are properly patched, despite what the same support team routinely tells those who bought copies and received defective Version 1.1.610 digital copies.
In short:
Free copy from EA/Origin Support for CD Key Redemption: Properly patched executable (1.1.641) Purchased copy from EA.com, the EA App, the Origin Store, or playing via EA Play/Xbox Game Pass: Unpatched and unpatchable executable (permanently locked to Version 1.1.610) For a more detailed assessment of the Origin situation, NAM developer Tarkus has written extensively on the subject at his blog, SimTarkus.
Note to Mac Users # Aspyr issued an update to their port of SimCity 4 Deluxe for macOS, updating it from a 32-bit app to a 64-bit one on both Steam and the App Store, allowing it to be compatible with macOS Catalina (10.15) and later. This change has introduced a number of quirks, however.
Most notably, it has changed the key combination for cycling through TAB Loops under the NAM\u0026rsquo;s various buttons. Instead of using TAB to move forward, and Shift-TAB to move in reverse, Mac users must now use Ctrl-TAB to move forward, and Ctrl-Shift-TAB to move in reverse. While TAB and Shift-TAB will allow one to move through the TAB Loop, these keys/combinations will cause some pieces under the buttons to be skipped.
Furthermore, the changes have also broken simmaster07\u0026rsquo;s SC4MacInjector, which allowed DLL plugins\u0026ndash;including SC4Fix.dll (which addressed the puzzle piece/TE Lot CTDs)\u0026ndash;to run on macOS. As such, these fixes no longer work on Mac, and users should exercise caution when placing stations in the vicinity of static puzzle pieces.
Additionally, the installation procedure for the NAM varies depending on if one is using the Steam version or the App Store version.
With the Steam version, the NAM will install into the correct location by default: /Users/{username}/Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins/.
The NAM Team is not familiar enough with the App Store version to give reliable installation instructions, and we would instead refer users to the SC4 Mac Users board at Simtropolis for assistance.
A Note About Drive Side (RHD vs. LHD) # While the NAM Installer, as noted above, has a series of checkboxes in Custom Installation relating to drive side, it is worth re-iterating that these boxes only change the compatibility files installed with the NAM, and do NOT change drive side. If you have an installation with Right-Hand Driving (RHD, vehicles driving on the right side of roads\u0026ndash;this concept is NOT the same as the side one sits on when driving a vehicle) and wish to switch to Left-Hand Driving (LHD, vehicles driving on the left side of roads), this generally needs to be done either by adjusting the game\u0026rsquo;s locale files, and then either editing the game\u0026rsquo;s Windows registry entries, or by modifying the game\u0026rsquo;s shortcut.
The new NAM Installer cannot determine default drive side of your installation, so make note of which side vehicles drive on in your game prior to installation. If you have changed your drive side by modifying the game\u0026rsquo;s shortcut, instead of editing the Windows registry, then this would be the one and only case when changing the box checked here would be needed.
A Note About the \u0026ldquo;4GB Patch\u0026rdquo; # Due to changes in computer systems, and continued expansions of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s main Controller file, in 2013, it was determined that many newer systems, particularly those with more than 4GB of RAM, and running 64-bit versions of Windows, need additional accommodation. To that end, the NAM includes a \u0026ldquo;4GB Patch\u0026rdquo;, also known as a \u0026ldquo;Large Address Aware (LAA) Patch\u0026rdquo;, which allows the game to access the full 4GB of RAM that a 32-bit application can read, instead of the default 2GB. The NAM\u0026rsquo;s patch was designed by NTCore, and built into the NAM with permission, and users with systems that need the patch will receive a prompt during NAM installation to install it. The original patch can be found here.
The only thing this patch does is to switch the Large Address Aware switch, an accessible switch present in all Windows executables, from \u0026ldquo;off\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; for the game\u0026rsquo;s executable. Patches like this are common in game modding communities, including those associated with The Elder Scrolls series (i.e. Skyrim), and Fallout, and can be used to enhance any 32-bit application\u0026rsquo;s performance on systems with 64-bit operating systems and a suitable amount of RAM.
The new installation starting point for Windows users\u0026ndash; NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version47.bat\u0026ndash;should ensure that your game is automatically patched as needed.
Note that the 4GB Patch is NOT required for users on macOS, as that version of the game is 64-bit and can access more RAM than the Windows version (even with the 4GB Patch!) by default.
The default directory for where SimCity 4.exe may be located depends on how and where you purchased your copy of the game.
GOG.com: C:\\GOG Games\\SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition\\Apps Steam: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\SimCity 4 Deluxe\\Apps Original Disc: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Maxis\\SimCity 4 Deluxe\\Apps Origin*: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Maxis\\SimCity 4 Deluxe\\Apps Note that only Origin copies acquired through Free CD Key Redemption (Version 1.1.641) are compatible with the NAM. Copies purchased through the Origin Store or accessed via Origin Access (Version 1.1.610) ARE NOT COMPATIBLE. See here for more details.
Uninstalling the NAM # To uninstall the files, simply bulldoze every NAM item from this download in your cities and remove the files from the Plugins folder afterwards, which will be contained in Plugins\\Network Addon Mod by default.
Changing Options After Initial Installation # The NAM is a very expansive mod, with a substantial number of features, which may initially prove overwhelming to those not well-versed in its workings. The NAM Team anticipates that users, particularly those new to the NAM, may want to change the feature set they have installed, as they learn more about the mod\u0026rsquo;s contents and capabilities.
To that end, we encourage users to keep the installer for the current version handy after initial installation. If you plan to change your particular set of options, you will need to remove your current installation. Moving it out of Plugins to a safe location is recommended, in case you want to keep your existing settings as a backup.
Manual Installation - Advanced # Users who are unable or unwilling to install Java can perform a manual installation of the NAM, something which the new file architecture introduced in 2020 makes far more possible than the previous \u0026ldquo;Monolithic\u0026rdquo; releases.
This method requires a file decompression tool capable of opening .jar files, such as 7-zip (Windows) or Keka (macOS). To begin, open NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version47.jar using your file decompression tool.
The NAM\u0026rsquo;s contents are located in the \u0026ldquo;installation\u0026rdquo; subfolder. The current installer uses a series of character flags at the start of directory names, in order to instruct the installer how to order the options, whether they\u0026rsquo;re mandatory or optional, etc.
Numbers preceded by the at sign (\u0026quot;@\u0026quot;), i.e. \u0026ldquo;@1\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;@2\u0026rdquo;, etc., are merely being ordered with this flag.
Any directory with the caret (\u0026quot;^\u0026quot;) in front of the name (or behind a \u0026ldquo;@\u0026rdquo; ordering flag) is mandatory.
Any directory with the exclamation mark (\u0026quot;!\u0026quot;) in front of the name (or behind a \u0026ldquo;@\u0026rdquo; ordering flag) is not installed by default.
Any options where the equal sign (\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;) and the dash (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;) are present are mutually exclusive\u0026ndash;only one should be installed (the \u0026ldquo;=\u0026rdquo; option is the default).
The \u0026ldquo;@1^Core\u0026rdquo; directory is required. All other folders have options within them. At least one of the folders starting with \u0026ldquo;0 NAM Controller\u0026rdquo; must be installed. With \u0026ldquo;4 Automata Controller#\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;9 Traffic Simulator#\u0026rdquo;, simply select one of the options inside and discard the rest, as these are straight up mutually exclusive one another. Within \u0026ldquo;8 Texture and Drive Side Support\u0026rdquo;, keep \u0026ldquo;z_Common Files\u0026rdquo;, then select either \u0026ldquo;-EU\u0026rdquo; (for EU textures) or \u0026ldquo;=US\u0026rdquo; (for US textures), and within \u0026ldquo;-EU\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;=US\u0026rdquo;, get rid of the \u0026ldquo;_RightSide\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;_LeftSide\u0026rdquo; (whichever does not coincide with the side the vehicles in your game drive), and decide if you want any (or none) of the other subfolder options (i.e. Cul-De-Sacs).
The Automata Controller basically affects the display of the visual traffic in-game\u0026ndash;Standard is going to be the lightest, while Radical is going to be the heaviest, Persistent makes the automata visuals last longer, and the 24-Hour modifiers handle whether the display is constant, or follows the data for the 24-Hour clock in-game.
The Texture and Drive Side Support includes four options, depending on whether you want to use US/North American textures or Euro/International Textures, and the drive side of your game (RHD or LHD, which should match your selection for the NAM Controller).
With the Traffic Simulator, these are ordered by the \u0026ldquo;@1\u0026rdquo; and the like in order of lowest capacity option to highest. Medium is the default.
With 5 DataView Options#, there\u0026rsquo;s two subfolders. Both are just straight up options, with nothing mutually exclusive. You can probably just leave this one as is, unless you really don\u0026rsquo;t like the Data View changes.
With 6 Miscellaneous, the two mutually exclusive options to watch out for are Extended Station Queries (there\u0026rsquo;s four options in there\u0026ndash;very subtle differences between them), and Maxis Transit Lots\\Airport Capacity Adjustment#, which has three options (Default, Medium, and Large). And the Hole Diggers and Raisers are very much recommended\u0026ndash;they have lots of use outside regular NAM usage, too.
With 3 Additional Transit Stations, this depends on if you want more transit stations beyond the game\u0026rsquo;s default, and what the NAM adds by default for certain additional override networks. There should be no harm in either adding this one in whole, or leaving it out altogether, and if there\u0026rsquo;s certain added stations you like/don\u0026rsquo;t like, you can go in and customize this later.
2 Additional Network Features is by far the biggest area of the installer. This contains all the actual network feature addons in the mod. Most networks/network groups will have a \u0026ldquo;Base Features\u0026rdquo; folder, which really ought to be mandatory, as it contains a lot of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s basic additions to each network, along with any Wide Radius/Multi Radius Curves and Fractional Angles, as well as Roundabout options for the various road-type networks.
The main \u0026ldquo;mutually exclusive\u0026rdquo; option to look out for here is with the Maxis Highways (there\u0026rsquo;s two options\u0026ndash;@1=Default Style, which keeps the Maxis Highways\u0026rsquo; default look and adds the NAM\u0026rsquo;s additions for it, or @2-Maxis Highway Override (RHW-Style), which completely reskins the Maxis Highways, removes access to the default interchanges, and replaces them with RHW-style modular interchange functionality and a few new ploppable interchanges. Using the RealHighway (RHW) option is pretty much mandatory if you\u0026rsquo;re going this route).
The other ones to watch out for are in Water Transport, where the Canal Addon Mod (CAN-AM) has two mutually-exclusive styles (@1=Callagrafx Style and @2-SimGoober Style), and there\u0026rsquo;s also quite a few \u0026ldquo;non-default\u0026rdquo; options in Roads, One-Way Roads, and Avenues.
Those three non-default options are !Legacy Auto Avenue Turn Lanes (these are the old auto-turn lanes that appear on Avenue x Avenue intersections\u0026ndash;largely considered \u0026ldquo;deprecated\u0026rdquo; now, as they can interfere with some newer functionality), !Legacy Semi-Auto Road Turn Lanes (the \u0026ldquo;semi-auto\u0026rdquo; replacement for the old auto-turn lanes on Road x Road intersections, which now appear by clicking over Road x Road + and T-intersections with the One-Way Road tool, also somewhat \u0026ldquo;deprecated\u0026rdquo; now), and !One-Way Road Arrow Plugins. These Arrow Plugins are mostly just a matter of taste, and, despite the folder naming, actually supposed to be mutually exclusive. \u0026ldquo;Elimination\u0026rdquo; gets rid of the arrows entirely, \u0026ldquo;Reduction\u0026rdquo; hides some of them (and actually impacts the base functionality of the OWR network to some degree), while \u0026ldquo;Single Arrows\u0026rdquo; replaces the default double arrows with just a single arrow (which looks nicer on the NWM networks).
The rest of 2 Additional Network Features is pretty self-explanatory, though micromanagement of these options is not recommended, since it is possible to produce a broken installation this way. RealRailway is the only/default option for Rail now, it\u0026rsquo;s best to go all or nothing on RealHighways (RHW) and the Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue folder\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Additional Widths and Turn Lanes\u0026rdquo; option (which contains the Network Widening Mod and FLEX Turn Lanes). And if something says \u0026ldquo;Legacy\u0026rdquo; but it\u0026rsquo;s not prefixed with \u0026ldquo;!\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s probably safest to install it, as it pertains to being able to keep certain older, deprecated content working, if you\u0026rsquo;ve built it with previous versions.
Information for Users on Lower-End Systems (32-Bit Windows/\u0026lt;4GB RAM) # Users attempting to run the NAM as installed by default with the full NAM Controller, on systems with 32-bit Windows and/or less than 4GB RAM, will not be able to make use of the required 4GB Patch, and will encounter Crash-to-Desktop (CTD) errors with that default Controller. The only solution to this is to either install NAMLite, or select one of the \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; options in the installer. Note that the \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; options do not include ANY code for the RealHighway (RHW) plugin, so attempting to build RHW systems will result in everything reverting to the base RHW-2 network. The single biggest contributor to the Controller\u0026rsquo;s size is the RealHighway (RHW) plugin, so not having it installed helps keep things under control on lower-end systems. Note that the NAM Controller is one of the most critical files in the entire mod; without a NAM Controller, none of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s menu buttons will function, instead resulting in a \u0026ldquo;red arrow\u0026rdquo; when clicked.
Users wishing to run just the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Traffic Simulator improvements should install NAMLite.
Distribution and Old Versions # The NAM Team only provides support and allows distribution of the most recent NAM version. With the exception of older non-English language versions (which are supported by their respective sites, not the NAM Team), no technical support will be provided to users of prior versions of the NAM, nor will any past versions of the NAM be made available for download, by request or otherwise. The team does not keep an official archive of past releases, and does not have the resources to answer questions regarding them. Each release includes improvements across the board to features new and old, is designed to be as compatible with cities built with previous versions as is humanly possible, and is also intended to improve the end user experience. Old releases are inherently inferior, and not \u0026ldquo;simpler\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;easier\u0026rdquo; to use.
Users wanting a smaller feature set, due to technical limitations, or unfamiliarity with the NAM\u0026rsquo;s vast options, should instead seek to install NAMLite, or fewer options in the current NAM, potentially coupled with the \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; option, .
Users wishing to hold onto old versions should back them up in their personal archives. Note again that no technical support will be provided for this, nor may any user or site redistribute any old versions.
When you\u0026rsquo;re done installing, it\u0026rsquo;s on to the Basics # `}),e.add({id:2,href:"/docs/getting-started/in-game-basics/",title:"The Basics",description:"The NAM has an incredibly exhaustive array of features -- understanding these concepts will make it much easier to use various tools in the NAM.",content:`DRAGGABLE, PLOPPABLE! # Just like many other elements of Sim City 4, the many options in the NAM are used by either “dragging” or “plopping”.
Simply put: drag a highway, plop a junction! Seem familiar?
OVERRIDES # There is one particular difference with the NAM from other mods and they are called Overrides. Many elements in the NAM are designed to be plopped and then dragged through. When this happens, they transform their initial appearance, updating and fitting itself into your design, overiding into a single, seamless network. Knowing what Overrides to use in the right place is where you’ll spend the most time learning in-game. This is the fun part as there are literally endless variations to choose from!
IN-GAME MENU # Within NAM’s menu you’ll find the following icons/categories. We’ll get into where and when to use each tool later on, so for now all we need to learn are the differences between them:
PUZZLE PIECES - A fixed, ploppable element that is static and does not override. STARTER PIECES - A ploppable element that does override, telling the game to ignore it’s default tool and use your chosen starter piece instead. Example, plop a single 4-lane highway starter piece down and then drag through it with the highway tool to build a 4-lane highway! Easy. FLEX PIECES - Another ploppable, pre-built element that does override. Example, you’ve built a highway but now you want to add a slip-road or ramp. Plop down a flex piece ramp directly on top and it’ll fit itself into your design just like that. Alternatively, drag though a piece and it’ll update. Flexible, wouldn’t you say? HOLE/RAISER TOOL - A simple tool that allows you to dig a hole (for tunnels) or raise the terrain (for bridges). ERASER - Unlike the standard in-game “Bulldozer” tool, the NAM’s Eraser allows minimal destruction! Erase one tile at a time. TRANSIT-ENABLED LOTS - A piece that accepts more than one type of network. Example, a transit station, allowing sims to switch from riding a train to walking. USING THE MENU # Simply choose your category from the menu, then use TAB to cycle forwards (SHIFT-TAB for backwards) through the loop of various options within that category. A hovering preview shows you what’s available. A small dialog box above that explains what that piece is. Don’t worry if some of the descriptions don’t make sense just yet — this guide will help there.
HOME and END keys allow you to rotate the piece on the map, just like buildings.
(Attention Steam Users: The Steam Overlay is set to use the key combination Shift-TAB by default. Through the Steam client, you will need to either change the key combination for the overlay, or disable it altogether in order to use cycle backwards through TAB loops)

Alongside the new elements NAM gives you, there\u0026rsquo;s some important things it changes to the game. Meaning some new:
FEATURES # NAM Traffic Simulator - From more realistic subway costs to smarter Sims, NAM features it\u0026rsquo;s own traffic simulator that improves efficiency, usage, pathfinding and realism across all networks. This feature is a huge improvement to the vanilla game. Automata Controller - A fancy name for vehicles. It was important to update how the game processes vehicles with all the changes NAM provides. This feature with NAM allows you choose how many vehicles you want on your roads. Data View - With all the new elements and features in NAM, it\u0026rsquo;s important to stay on top of them all. Therefore NAM features an improved version of the Traffic Volume View. New Tools - As previously mentioned, NAM comes with it\u0026rsquo;s own set of powerful tools (Hole Diggers and Erasers) giving you more powerful functionality in-game. CONTENT # Roads, Streets and Highways # RealHighway (RHW) - Most folks install NAM just for these highways, it\u0026rsquo;s the main attraction! RHW adds an entire new realm of potential for creating highway networks, completely replacing the original Maxis highways, adding huge multi-lane options, overpasses, ramps, elevations\u0026hellip; RealExpressway (REW) - Just like the RHW, RealExpressway adds ramps and slip-roads to the Road network, bringing the same flexibility to your cities and towns. Network Widening Mod - Ever needed something more than a road or avenue but not a highway? Introducing the Network Widening Mod, extending the game\u0026rsquo;s base road networks by providing different widths! Pedestrian Addon Mod (PRM) - Introduce pedestrian crossings and malls! This revolutionary new feature gets your sims out of cars and on their feet or on a bike. Street Addon Mod (SAM) - The game shipped with only one grey street. This mod adds parking lots, gravel tracks, dirt paths, brick and cobblestone streets and a lot more. Rural Roads (RuRP) - Asphalt streets in the middle of nowhere? Don\u0026rsquo;t think so. Add rural roads for a scenic route or mountain pass! Rail Networks # High Speed Rail - Build monorails (elevated and/or ground level) around your city\u0026rsquo;s busiest areas. Hybrid Rail - A combo rail network that allows both heavy and high-speed traffic. Light Rail - An urban/suburban network, along the lines of tram or streetcars. RealRailway - A complete rail network replacement (with redesigned tracks!). This is the meat and potatoes, making the vanilla game drive like it\u0026rsquo;s on rails! Underground Rail - Create subways and other below-ground rail networks for passengers and freight. Infrastructure # Bridges \u0026amp; Viaducts - Over 130 new variations of Bridges to choose from! Anything from small brick road viaducts to huge steel railway suspension bridges! Canals - Functional canals (they act the same as buses behind the scenes) add a whole new dimension to a city. You could make Venice! Stations - Add more variety to your railways with all new stations - supporting elevated networks, too. Underpasses - Sometimes the terrain just isn\u0026rsquo;t your friend. Or maybe you need a road and can\u0026rsquo;t bring yourself to bulldoze that part of your city. Enter flexible underpasses, allowing car traffic where the sun don\u0026rsquo;t shine! Roundabouts - All roads lead to this. Draw or plop all-new roundabouts on roads, avenues and even highways and ease the congestion. Other Content # Maxis Highway Override - Enjoy the ease of pre-built, complicated junctions like the old Maxis highways had? This new feature brings that feature back, but this time supported NAM\u0026rsquo;s superior RHW. Turning Lanes \u0026amp; Cosmetic Additions - Use ploppable (and flexible!) pieces to add lanes with turning arrows in your roads and highways. Additionally, a separate cosmetic option allows you to drop down turning arrows on almost all roads. `}),e.add({id:4,href:"/docs/getting-started/frequently-asked-questions/",title:"Frequently Asked Questions",description:"These are the most common questions that have been asked about the Network Addon Mod.",content:` What is the Network Addon Mod?
If you do not know the answer to this, that means you\u0026rsquo;ve skipped the very important Start Here page.
What is the difference between NAM and NAMLite?
NAMLite is a bite-sized package for users looking for a minimal install. Think of NAMLite as a \u0026ldquo;best hits\u0026rdquo;.
Why is my game crashing to desktop when I load a city tile after installing this mod?
The crash to desktop (CTD) issues upon city load are the product of having a full NAM Controller installed, but without the NTCore 4GB Patch being properly installed. The .bat file recommended for Windows users to use to begin NAM installation should patch your game automatically, but Windows permissions issues can complicate this (running the .bat file as an administrator can help), and the presence of these sorts of CTDs are an indication that the process did not properly complete.
The 4GB Patch is a small patch, usable on any 32-bit executable file (not just SimCity 4) that allows the application to access 4GB RAM instead of a mere 2GB, and has historically been used in many modding communities associated with older games. This can also happen if your system is running a 32-bit version of Windows (i.e. if you\u0026rsquo;re still running Windows XP), and/or you have less than 4GB RAM. Both of these situations effectively render the improvements of the 4GB Patch (and the compatibility it provides with the Full version of the NAM Controller) moot. Note that the \u0026ldquo;LowRam/NoRHW\u0026rdquo; Controller options do not require the 4GB Patch, but they completely omit almost all the code required for the NAM\u0026rsquo;s RealHighway (RHW) Plugin to function.
Does this mod work on a Mac?
Yes. The NAM is a cross-platform mod, with a cross-platform Java installer. Being cross-platform, it will run on macOS, provided Java has been installed. The version of Java included in this package is for Windows users, so it will not work for you. Instead, go to Adoptium or Oracle to download a Mac version of Java. Also, since Aspyr updated the Mac port of SimCity 4 to be a 64-bit application (and as of January 2023, has also implemented Apple Silicon support), the 4GB Patch is NOT required for Mac users.
One quirk to note is that NAM network items in TAB Loops will require the user to press Ctrl-TAB or Ctrl-Shift-TAB to cycle through, rather than the mere TAB or Shift-TAB on other operating systems (or the earlier Mac version), in order to access all the items available under each menu button.
How much hard drive space will the NAM require?
It depends on the options you install. Expect about about 1.2GB for a full NAM install with the RealHighway plugin, down to about 30MB if you\u0026rsquo;ve installed NAM Lite.
Will this mod impact game performance?
Adding any Plugins to the game will impact performance to at least some extent\u0026ndash;more for the game to load. With modern hardware (as of 2023), the most prominent impacts is will be with the initial load of the game, and when loading a city tile for the first time after that initial load. This can be a noticeable difference, particularly if you\u0026rsquo;ve installed the full NAM after running completely \u0026ldquo;vanilla\u0026rdquo; (without plugins).
What all is included in the NAM?
Check out the Content Overview page for a brief look, and the full Features section of this documentation for a more in-depth look. The contents of the latest version can be found in the History section.
Is this mod stable?
The NAM has been around for almost 19 years, and is the most widely-used mod for SimCity 4 Deluxe/Rush Hour. While there are always things in the NAM that are being improved, it has such wide acceptance because it is generally considered to be a stable addition to the game. If you encounter issues while using the mod, the NAM Team would like to know, as we want to ensure users of this mod have an enjoyable experience.
Is using this mod considered cheating?
The consensus of most SC4 players is that it is not. The NAM restores the traffic simulator to something much more in line with what Maxis originally intended, before they were forced to significantly down-tune it in order to allow the game to run on a 500MHz Pentium III. While the NAM does allow one to adjust the capacity of the simulator, potentially up to levels significantly higher than the base game, using the \u0026ldquo;Classic\u0026rdquo; setting can actually provide an experience that is more challenging than that offered by the base game. Many of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s expansions are designed to provide more options for managing one\u0026rsquo;s grid, and they are, to the greatest extent possible, designed to be functional additions, not cheats.
Is the NAM compatible with other transportation mods?
The NAM includes modifications to the Network Rule (\u0026ldquo;RUL\u0026rdquo;) files (which handle network placement) and the Traffic Simulator Exemplar. It is not compatible with any other mod that modifies these files. Aside from earlier versions of the NAM, there are very few of these files out there. Things like stations (e.g. for Ground Light Rail/Tram, High Speed Rail, etc.) and cosmetic mods (e.g. Euro textures, different streetlights, etc.) are compatible with the NAM. Older cosmetic mods not maintained by the team, however, may not have full coverage of all relevant NAM items.
Do I need to remove previous versions of the NAM and its related plugins?
Yes. This has changed since the release of NAM 37 in July 2020. The NAM\u0026rsquo;s contents are by default installed to the My Documents\\SimCity 4\\Plugins\\Network Addon Mod directory (on Windows, and similar directories on other OSes). NAM 31 through NAM 36 also utilized a \u0026ldquo;z___NAM\u0026rdquo; folder in that same Plugins directory, which should also be removed.
How do EA and Maxis feel about this mod? Is it legal?
The NAM is 100% legal, and Maxis was extremely supportive of our efforts. Maxis employee Frank Simon (AKA MaxisFrank) actually encouraged NAM co-founder the7trumpets to undertake modification of the traffic simulator, as the company could not issue a patch themselves, due to the need to still meet the published minimum technical requirements.
EA is currently using a series of screenshots featuring the NAM on their official page for SimCity 4 (though ironically, the version for sale on that page is the EA App version, which features a Version 1.1.610 executable and is not supported by the NAM).
What is this CAM thing? Is it related to the NAM?
The NAM and CAM (short for Colossus Addon Mod) are completely unrelated mods. The NAM deals with transportation networks, whereas the CAM affects the simulation of growable RCI buildings, by adding new growth stages. The still-available original version of the CAM (CAM 1.0, July 2007) does include an optional traffic simulator plugin, which is incompatible with the NAM\u0026rsquo;s traffic simulator plugins, and should not be installed if using the NAM. The CAM\u0026rsquo;s creators believe the current NAM simulator is vastly more suited to the CAM than the CAM traffic plugin. The traffic plugin was removed in the later CAM 2.x releases published by InvisiChem.
Are there any tutorials or videos that help explain this mod and its functionality?
Yes, there are some tutorials included in this documentation. There are also quite a few on the main SC4 forums, as well as on YouTube, but considering that the NAM has actually been around longer than YouTube (!), it is important to pay attention to the date of tutorial, as the NAM has changed significantly since the early days, and is still changing (particularly in light of the long-term project to move away from standard puzzle pieces).
Does the NAM have dependencies?
The NAM requires zero dependencies. Since the NAM struck down its long-standing prohibition on including lots back in 2013, basic stations for some of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s additional rail-type network options are even part of the package now. If you are encountering the infamous \u0026ldquo;brown boxes\u0026rdquo; anywhere, they are the product of having a non-NAM mod or plugin installed, without all its dependencies.
Why is the game crashing to desktop immediately upon loading after installing this mod?
The only reason the NAM could cause an immediate crash to desktop (CTD) would be if you\u0026rsquo;re running the original version of SimCity 4 (not Deluxe/Rush Hour), or if your game is improperly configured for your hardware (in which case it will crash similarly without the NAM). If you are running Deluxe/Rush Hour, you may want to check any other plugins you may have installed.
What\u0026rsquo;s with all the acronyms? Is there a list of what they all mean?
Acronyms are omnipresent in the SC4 content world, and they serve a valuable purpose as shorthand. They can seem a bit arcane at first, however. The Glossary in this documentation contains all the pertinent NAM-related ones you may encounter.
Why are none of the icons showing up after I\u0026rsquo;ve installed the NAM?
You may not have installed the NAM correctly. See the Installation Instructions page.
Why am I seeing duplicate icons?
You may have two copies of a given NAM plugin installed. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to find and remove the duplicate, which could be from an earlier NAM or NAM component plugin release, which could interfere with your NAM installation in other ways.
Why am I getting a red arrow/gray cursor when I click one of the new icons in game?
In most situations, this is an indication that you have the Controller file from an outdated NAM release, or an incompatible RUL-bound transit mod installed. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to remove the offending files. The one exception is with the little icon with the NAM logo at the bottom of the Highways menu\u0026ndash;this button is not meant to be pressed, but rather, hovered over to show version information. If the version information here says anything other than \u0026ldquo;47\u0026rdquo;, that\u0026rsquo;s a definite sign there\u0026rsquo;s an outdated/incompatible file lurking about your Plugins folder.
After installing the NAM, why are the tiles leading up to my intersections suddenly orange or red in the Congestion Data View?
The NAM\u0026rsquo;s traffic simulator plugin, with its default settings, amplifies the effect of the Intersection and Turn Capacity Effect property, affecting network tiles that are within a 2-tile radius of an intersection (or transition) to better simulate the effects of queues at intersections (esp. signalized ones).
Why are the cars disappearing in game?
The \u0026ldquo;cars\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;automata\u0026rdquo;, are not really there in the traffic simulation\u0026ndash;they\u0026rsquo;re simply a visual effect that merely has a casual correlation to actual traffic data in the game. Being visual effects, they can eat up processing power, and in order to keep the game from becoming overloaded, the game\u0026rsquo;s engine puts a finite limit on how many vehicular automata can show up at one time. Over that limit, and they disappear. Certain Automata Plugin options can allow more automata to stay on the screen at one time, though keeping the cars on the road all the time is simply an impossibility, due to the way the game is programmed. SimCity 4 is a statistics-based simulator, not an agent-based simulator (as SimCity (2013) and Cities: Skylines are).
What are the differences between \u0026ldquo;puzzle pieces\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;FLEX pieces\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;starter pieces\u0026rdquo;, and TE lots\u0026quot;?
Puzzle pieces are ploppable network items, and are placed through the IntersectionOrdering RUL file (also known as RUL 0x10000000 or RUL-0). The interchanges included in the base game for the Elevated and Ground Highway networks are puzzle pieces. They are effectively static in their implementation\u0026ndash;once they are plopped, they cannot be altered without bulldozing. In effect, they are old dogs that cannot be taught new tricks.
Starter pieces are ploppable network items, usually small in size, which are designed primarily to initiate a network override, allowing any of the game\u0026rsquo;s draggable base networks to assume a new appearance and/or new functionality, often to the point of behaving like new networks. One simply places an instance of the starter piece, and drags the appropriate base network through the starter piece to initiate the override. The technique used to make them was first developed by smoncrie in 2006, and was first used in the implementation of Draggable Ground Light Rail (GLR) in the Version 21 release of June 2007. Examples of starter pieces can be found all throughout the NAM, particularly with the RealHighway (RHW) plugin, the Network Widening Mod (NWM), and the Street Addon Mod (SAM).
FLEX pieces might initially appear to be identical to puzzle pieces, as they are also ploppable items, but unlike garden variety puzzle pieces, they can be taught new tricks, and can change to better fit their surroundings, accepting input from starter pieces, or sometimes even acting as combination starter pieces/transitions. Examples of these include the Diagonal Street Helper Pieces, the Avenue Roundabouts, and many newer components in the RealHighway (RHW) system (almost all of which are prefaced by the term \u0026ldquo;FLEX\u0026rdquo; in their name). Because of this, a single FLEX piece can fulfill a range of functions that could otherwise require as many as 50 conventional puzzle pieces. The game also treats FLEX pieces more akin to draggable network items upon their placement in the game.
TE lots (short for transit-enabled lots) are lot-based items, also ploppable, but are not RUL bound, and are primarily intended to allow one\u0026rsquo;s sims to switch transit types (i.e. from being on a train to walking) or add some non-transit purpose to a particular stretch of a network. The most common uses of TE lots are transit stations and toll booths.
How do I move between the different puzzle/FLEX/starter pieces, and how do I rotate them?
The TAB key will move forward through a given set of puzzle pieces under a single icon, and Shift-TAB will move backwards. Rotation is accomplished through the Home and End keys. On macOS, it is actually Ctrl-TAB and Ctrl-Shift-TAB (TAB and Shift-TAB will still work, but will tend to skip every other item).
What is up with the icon with the NAM logo at the bottom of the Highways menu, and why does it do nothing when I click it?
The NAM logo icon is a diagnostic tool, which, if hovered over, will show you which version of the NAM Controller you are currently running. This can be useful in diagnosing issues pertaining to the NAM Controller. It is not supposed to do anything when you click it.
Why is the game crashing after I place a puzzle piece?
This is a bug in the game itself, typically triggered by attempting to place conventional puzzle pieces in the vicinity of TE lots. If, in the process of constructing a puzzle piece, the footprint of the puzzle piece overlaps that of the TE lot, even before the puzzle piece is placed, the game generally does not understand the configuration, and will immediately crash. This is an issue within the game\u0026rsquo;s executable, and as a result, it was long deemed an unsolvable issue.
However, simmaster07 managed to decode enough of the framework that SimCity 4 uses to load DLL files from other sources, and was able to patch this issue with his SC4Fix.dll file. SC4Fix is available at Simtropolis.
Why isn\u0026rsquo;t it possible to add true new networks, instead of using starter pieces?
Adding new networks is, at this time, impossible. The base RHW network was only possible as it used an unused network stub left in the game. Although game files suggest that theoretically, there is space for three more true networks (for a total of 16), there is not enough of a stub for these final three slots for us to enable them. The starter piece paradigm allows us to very closely mimic the effects of adding true new networks, however.
Why haven\u0026rsquo;t you guys added submenus instead of using TAB loops?
Adding new submenus is, at this time, impossible. SC4 mod developers have tried for many years, to no avail, though have come up with workarounds like Daeley\u0026rsquo;s Advanced Menu Navigator (DAMN), which repurposes the game\u0026rsquo;s News system, and Menu Management Lots (MMLs).
Certain draggable items are not working for me, and I\u0026rsquo;m following the directions. Why isn\u0026rsquo;t it working?
If you\u0026rsquo;re referring to starter pieces, make sure you\u0026rsquo;re dragging the specified default network out the correct end of the piece. Trying to \u0026ldquo;drag\u0026rdquo; the actual starter piece itself will get you nowhere. If you\u0026rsquo;re referring to a starter piece-based network extension not cooperating with a particular setup you\u0026rsquo;re trying to build, it may be that the setup is not supported. If you\u0026rsquo;re getting \u0026ldquo;blank\u0026rdquo; tiles upon drawing the item, this is generally a sign of improper installation and/or conflicting files being present in your Plugins.
My RCI demand seems to have changed since I installed the NAM. What is happening?
The NAM does not directly affect RCI demand. It does not modify anything other than transportation-related files. You may have installed something else recently that does modify other parts of the game, however. Because the NAM is popular and a large-scale mod, many newer players who have installed other files at the same time mistakenly presume the NAM is at fault. Additionally, if you somehow unchecked too many boxes in the installer, it is possible you somehow caused the installer to skip installation of the Traffic Simulator plugin, which would cause the game to revert to the Maxis defaults.
I\u0026rsquo;m having difficulty using U-Drive-It (UDI) functionality on certain NAM items. Is there any way to fix this?
It depends on the item\u0026ndash;Single-Track Rails (STR) and the various Turning Lane Avenue (TLA) options in the Network Widening Mod (NWM) are perhaps the most prone to issues. UDI was a last-minute addition to SimCity 4 Deluxe/Rush Hour, and is known for having a number of quirks. There really isn\u0026rsquo;t a way to fix them because of these quirks, though the TLA quirks can be mitigated by disabling \u0026ldquo;Snap To Road\u0026rdquo; and driving manually.
I\u0026rsquo;m from North America. Why aren\u0026rsquo;t the traffic signals so they\u0026rsquo;re on the far side of the intersection, as they are here? Can I change this?
The way the game\u0026rsquo;s default traffic signals work with the stop point system on network path files, the signals have to be on the near-side in order to function. Some of the FLEX Turn Lane (FTL) options and Turn Lane Extension Pieces (TuLEPs) use trick stop points to allow for far-side signals, but there are feasible limits to this technique. Recently, however, there have been advances in signal modding, using true-3D props, which have allowed for offset props to be developed, getting around this issue. Offset props have not been released as of writing, but may potentially be made available as a third-party addition in the future.
I\u0026rsquo;m from a country where people drive on the left. Can I switch the side of the traffic signals?
Yes. Check out the Signal Replacement Project, developed by NAM Team member MandelSoft. Please note that MandelSoft is no longer active in the SC4 community, and newer items may not be covered by that mod. It is not the NAM Team\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to update independent cosmetic mods.
Should I use the SC4 DatPacker or JDatPacker tools to consolidate my NAM installation into a single file?
With the Mac version, it is effectively required to consolidate the mods files using JDatPacker, due to the \u0026ldquo;number-of-files limit\u0026rdquo; issue. With the Windows version, it will speed up load times, but you\u0026rsquo;ll need to ensure you remove the DatPacked files upon installing any NAM updates, or else they will interfere with the proper functionality of the update. Unless you also preserve your pre-DatPacked NAM installation, you will also be unable to use the NAM installer\u0026rsquo;s ability to install the same options when updating to a new version. As such, the NAM Team generally does not recommend that Windows users DatPack their installations.
How do I build an interchange with the RealHighway (RHW) system?
Rather than the pre-fabricated, one-piece interchanges of the game\u0026rsquo;s default highway system, the RealHighway system was designed with the concept of modular interchange construction in mind. More details can be found in the RHW portion of the documentation. That said, NAM 45 (September 2022) did introduce the QuickChange Xpress (QCX) system, which currently adds full diamond interchanges to the RHW\u0026rsquo;s repertoire. These can be found under the QuickChanges button on the Highways Menu.
Why aren\u0026rsquo;t my neighbor connections working on RealHighways and/or wider Roads, Avenues and One-Way Roads? How do I fix them?
Most RealHighways (except the RHW-2 and RHW-3 networks) and some multi-tile starter-based items require the use of special \u0026ldquo;Neighbor Connector Puzzle Pieces\u0026rdquo; (NCPPs) to function. For networks that are \u0026ldquo;combined\u0026rdquo;, having adjacent two-way traffic, simply drag the network to the edge of the city tile, as you normally would (ignoring the fact that the neighbor connection arrows both face the same direction), and plop the appropriate Neighbor Connection Puzzle Piece over it. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to do this on both sides of the neighbor connection. For one-way/\u0026ldquo;split\u0026rdquo; networks, follow the same directions, and if there is a gap between the two directions, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to place underground loop pieces next to the city edge, between the two carriageways.
Why are my RealHighway networks remaining at two lanes and ground level after dragging the network through one of the starter pieces?
If your RealHighway starters are not working, and the network is remaining as the RealHighway-2 (RHW-2) after dragging through a starter, then this is likely a sign that you have the \u0026ldquo;LowRAM/NoRHW\u0026rdquo; version of the NAM Controller installed, which, as the name indicates, does not include any of the RUL2 code necessary for the RealHighway\u0026rsquo;s starters to function. Reinstall the mod with the Full version of the Controller, and ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements for the RealHighway plugin (4GB Patch installed, 64-bit operating system, and at least 4GB RAM).
Why can\u0026rsquo;t I build diagonal intersections with some of the wider Roads, Avenues and One-Way Roads?
As of NAM 46, diagonal 4-way (\u0026quot;+\u0026quot;) intersections and crossings are now possible betwen the single-tile Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks (TLA-3, AVE-2, ARD-3, OWR-1, OWR-3, and NRD-4) with all of the game\u0026rsquo;s base networks, plus Ground Light Rail (GLR), Single-Track Rail (STR), and all other single-tile NWM networks. 3-way (\u0026ldquo;T\u0026rdquo;) intersections are not presently available, nor are any diagonal intersection or crossing options for the multi-tile NWM networks.
When is the next NAM version being released?
There is no date or timeline for the next release. We honestly have no idea. This project is a very passionate hobby for many NAM Team members, but it is still just that\u0026ndash;a hobby, something we do in our spare time, as volunteers. It\u0026rsquo;s also a technically complex undertaking, where things can unexpectedly go wrong in development. It\u0026rsquo;s simply not possible for us to predict when we\u0026rsquo;ll be done with a release, and coming up with arbitrary release dates just leads to extremely buggy releases or postponement, disappointing everyone in the process. The one time we did it (in 2013), it did not go well. Besides, we like to surprise people.
I\u0026rsquo;m a user from outside the North America\u0026ndash;are there Euro road textures to make the roads look more familiar to me?
Yes, just select either the \u0026ldquo;EU_Right Side\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;EU_Left Side\u0026rdquo; option (depending on your drive side) under \u0026ldquo;8 Texture and Drive Side Support\u0026rdquo;.
I have ideas for new features. Does the NAM Team take requests?
Certainly. That said, being the transportation fiends we are, we probably want a lot of the same stuff you do, and there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance it\u0026rsquo;s either in development or planned.
I\u0026rsquo;d like to contribute to the NAM. How do I do so?
As far membership on the NAM Team or the NAM Associates testing group goes, we\u0026rsquo;re always on the lookout for folks with the right skills on the forums. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to add something to the mod, show us a prototype of some sort\u0026ndash;we\u0026rsquo;ll help you figure out the best way to realize it. We don\u0026rsquo;t, however, have open sign-ups for development or testing positions.
Are you guys crazy, making this extensive mod for a 20-year-old game?!
Yes. Always have been, always will be.

ABEP: Arthur Berkhardt Expressway Project. An \u0026ldquo;April Fools Day\u0026rdquo; cosmetic mod produced by Tarkus for the RealHighway\u0026rsquo;s RHW-8S network, inspired by the episode of the American comedy series \u0026ldquo;Seinfeld\u0026rdquo; (Season 8, Episode 16, \u0026ldquo;The Pothole\u0026rdquo;).
ATL: Avenue Turning Lanes. An optional but now deprecated NAM feature, which adds turn lanes to +-intersections between two orthogonal Avenues. It has since been superseded by the FLEX Turn Lanes.
AVE: Avenue. An abbreviation used not only to refer to the game\u0026rsquo;s default Avenue network (sometimes called \u0026ldquo;AVE-4\u0026rdquo; in this short hand, because it has 4 lanes), but also the single-tile 2-lane (AVE-2) and triple-tile 6-lane (AVE-6) networks with divided medians, included in the Network Widening Mod (both of which are actually Road-based override networks built from starter pieces, as single-tile and triple-tile networks are extraordinary difficult to build from the dual-tile Avenue network).
BTM: Bullet Train Mod (also called Shinkansen Addon Mod). Refers to two separate Monorail replacement mods, both of which were popularized by Haljackey. The first was developed by the Japanese content creator APTX, while the second was developed by another Japanese creator, Moonlight (sometimes known as Moonlinght). The Moonlight version was a cosmetic override options available for the Monorail until NAM 36, since deprecated and pending publication as a legacy package.
CAN-AM: Canal Addon Mod. A NAM transportation that allows for fully functional transportation via Canal, using puzzle pieces. Developed by daeley, Chrisim, and members of the BSC.
CP: Cosmetic Piece. Cosmetic Pieces are specialized puzzle pieces, designed to allow users desiring great attention to detail to customize the look and feel of their transportation networks. The best known Cosmetic Pieces are included in the RealHighway system.
DBE: Diagonal Bridge Enabler. A Plugin that uses temporary files, draining all of a city\u0026rsquo;s water and locking road and rail slopes, to allow the construction of diagonal bridges and other advanced bridge designs from starter pieces.
DIP: Distilled Intersection Path. A Distilled Intersection Path is a bogus path designed to trick the game into thinking that a non-intersection tile is an intersection tile. Coupled with the settings for intersection capacity in the NAM Traffic Simulator, DIPs actually increase the capacity of affected tiles by 25%. They cannot be used on any network tile that already has an intersection or crossover path. DIPs are used to adjust capacities of wider networks in the RealHighway (RHW) system, the Network Widening Mod (NWM), some Turn Lane Extension Pieces (TuLEPs), some FLEX Turn Lanes (FTLs), and to induce congestion approach effects in the Mid-block Crosswalks (MBCs).
Draggable: A network item that can be built by using the dragging/drawing mechanism of the game\u0026rsquo;s base network tools, often by using a specific drag pattern.
Elevation/Level: With the Network Addon Mod, networks can be built in up to 6 elevation/level options:
L0, 0m (Ground Level): default for most networks, where the network\u0026rsquo;s surface is at the ground level, or minimally elevated (0.5m) as is the case with the Maxis Highway and Maxis Highway override, two model-based road networks using full 3D models instead of flat planes. L1 / 7.5 m: network elevation first introduced through the RealHighway and since expanded to the RealRailway, base network surface roads (Street, Road, OWR, AVE) and the Hybrid Railway. L2 / 15.0m (road networks) 15.5m (rail networks): network elevation introduced by several game default networks, including the elevated Maxis Highway, the Monorail and the Elevated Light Rail. Early on, this was the standard for most NAM elevated network items, but is in the process of being relegated to a secondary and more niche role. L3 / 22.5 m: network elevation introduced by the RealHighway and used exclusively by MIS, RHW-4 and RHW-6S, to allow the construction of multi-level interchanges. L4 / 30.0 m: network elevation first introduced with the High Elevated Rail and High Monorail puzzle pieces, later expanded to include MIS, RHW-4 and RHW-6S for multi-level interchange construction. Underground (U, subway view level): network elevation introduced by the game through the Subway network, since then expanded to the subway-based FLUP U-Road networks, the underground counterparts of all single tile RHW networks, introduced since NAM 39. ELR, El-Rail: Elevated Light Rail. An acronym sometimes used to refer to the game\u0026rsquo;s default Elevated Rail network, particularly when discussing its ground-level counterpart, Ground Light Rail (GLR).
EMHW: Elevated Maxis Highway. An acronym sometimes used to refer to the game\u0026rsquo;s default Elevated Highway network.
ERHW: Elevated RealHighway. An acronym sometimes used to refer to Elevated RealHighways.
ETRM: Euro Texture Replacement Mod. A cosmetic mod designed to change the appearance of roads to look more European/International, rather than the American default. The original version was by frimi2 of the SimForum.de BAT Team (SFBT), and the most recent version is by MandelSoft. Options for European and international style texture replacements have been reduced in number since NAM 37, in favor of a single generic European style network texture option.
ESURE: Express Subways and Underground Rail Extensions. This special piece allows subway lines to cross without forming a full intersection, allowing them to operate independently from one another, akin to an overpass crossing. They also provide transition and crossing functionality for cases where they\u0026rsquo;re otherwise unsupported.
FURL: Four-way Underground Rail Lots. These provide crossing functionality for Underground Rail alignments, supporting turning maneuvers and full intersection maneuvers for various U-Rail lines converging on the same tile. SURC: Subway to Underground Rail Connectors. These are transit-enabled lots supporting the transition between Passenger Rail (in Underground Rail) and Subway traffic. FA: Fractional Angle. A network piece that is neither orthogonal (0° or 90°), nor diagonal (45°), but in between the two. As of NAM 45, FA content exists in the following angles:
FA-1.5: the network shifts 1 tile to the side for every 1.5 tiles it moves forward, equivalent to shifting 2 tiles to the side for every 3 tiles it moves forward. Equivalent angles are 33.7° and 56.3°. FA-2: the network shifts 1 tile to the side for every 2 tiles it moves forward. Equivalent angles are 26.6° and 63.4°. FA-2 Alt (Alternative): the network shifts 1 tile to the side for every 2 tiles it moves forward. Equivalent angles are 26.6° and 63.4°. Unlike FA-2, this one uses a different footprint, and in the case of rail networks, it supports more sophisticated turnouts and smoother curves. FA-3: the network shifts 1 tile to the side for every 3 tiles it moves forward. Equivalent angles are 18.4° and 71.6°. FA-6: the network shifts 1 tile to the side for every 6 tiles it moves forward. Equivalent angles are 9.5° and 80.5°. As of NAM 45, Fractional Angle alignments are supported by the following networks:
FAA: Fractional Angle Avenue. As of NAM 45, it only has limited puzzle piece support for the FA-3 alignment. FAHRW: Fractional Angle Hybrid Railway. As of NAM 44, FLEX piece support for the FA-2 Alternative alignment was introduced. FAMHW, FAMHO: Fractional Angle Maxis Highway and Fractional Angle Maxis Highway Override. As of NAM 44, both networks have limited FA-3 support for their ground-level versions through puzzle pieces. FAOWR: Fractional Angle One-Way Road. As of NAM 45, it has limited FA-3 support in puzzle piece form. FAR: Fractional Angle Road. As of NAM 45, it has both puzzle piece and drag pattern support, for FA-1.5, FA-2 and FA-3 alignments. FARHW: Fractional Angle RealHighway. As of NAM 45, it has some puzzle piece support for most ground-level (L0) RHW overrides, with the exception of RHW-3, and limited RHW-6C, 8S, 8C and 10S support. All current support is in the FA-3 alignment. FARR: Fractional Angle Railroad. As of NAM 45, it has the greatest support, featuring FA-1.5 (limited), FA-2 (moderate), FA-2 Alternative (moderate), FA-3 (extensive) and FA-6 (limited) support, including the only elevated FA support of any network in the NAM, first introduced in NAM 38 for FA-2 at the L1 elevation. FHW: FakeHighway. A pejorative term sometimes used to describe MHW, due to the fact that it is half-scaled compared to other game networks.
FLEX Piece: A ploppable network item which, unlike a standard puzzle piece, which is static, is dynamic, and can accept overrides from draggable networks. This allows a single FLEX Piece to incorporate functionality that would take anywhere from a few to hundreds of traditional puzzle pieces in order to implement.
FLUPs: Flexible Underpasses. A system of modular underground network items, covering Roads/Highways, GLR/Tram, and Tram Dual-Networks. (Rail coverage is via the URail system.) It comes in two implementations:
Draggable/Subway-Based FLUPs: The draggable, Subway-based FLUPs were introduced in NAM 39, developed by Tarkus and Girafe, covering only Road and RealHighway (RHW) networks. They use overrides of the Subway network and FLEX Piece overcrossings, to allow for draggable underground and curving tunnels. This implementation can go under Buildings and Lots, but does not support traffic underwater. Puzzle Piece FLUPs: The original implementation of FLUPs, first deployed by Chrisim in NAM 24, which uses puzzle piece-based portals, network undercrossings, and blank terrain tiles, and supports Roads, One-Way Roads, Streets, Avenues, PedMalls, Ground Light Rail, and Tram-in-Avenue. It cannot go under Buildings or Lots, unlike the Subway-based draggable system, but can support traffic underwater. FTL: FLEX Turn Lane. A series of draggable/FLEX-based turn lane features for the various surface road networks, the networks in the Network Widening Mod (NWM), and the RealHighway (RHW). The naming scheme for FLEX turn lanes consists of declaring the lane configuration it possesses, starting with the cross-median turning lanes (RHD traffic\u0026rsquo;s left turn, LHD traffic\u0026rsquo;s right turn), then the through lanes, and finally the outer turning lanes (RHD traffic\u0026rsquo;s right turn, LHD Traffic\u0026rsquo;s left turn). As an example, Road networks use the FTL-110, consisting of a 1 cross-median turn lanes, 1 through and 0 outer turn lanes; as well as the FTL-101 when used to end a Road on a T intersection, with 1 cross-median, 0 through, and 1 outer turn lane. Other related terms within the FTL ecosystem include the following:
QuickTurn (or QuickFTL): Pre-fabricated FLEX Turn Lane intersection configurations, which feature FTL approaches and FLEX intersection pieces pre-assembled into an easy-to-use package. These are available in + and T intersection configurations. GID: Group ID. See TGI.
GLR: Ground Light Rail. A ground-level counterpart to the game\u0026rsquo;s default Elevated Rail network (sometimes also called the \u0026ldquo;Tram\u0026rdquo; network). It exists in several style variants, all of which are Elevated Rail-based override networks built from a starter piece, and dual-networking options, embedded in Avenues, Roads, and Streets, also exist (see T-RAM, TIA, TIR, TOR, and TOS).
GMHW: Ground Maxis Highway. An acronym sometimes used to refer to the game\u0026rsquo;s default Ground Highway network.
HRW: Hybrid Railway. A FLEX-based dual network, first introduced in NAM 38 and gradually expanded since, combining Rail and Monorail. This network is equivalent to conventional railway main lines with high-speed rail passenger services. It also features catenaries.
HSRP: High Speed Rail Project. A project which adds starter piece-based mass transit networks based upon the Monorail network. The two components included are the Elevated High Speed Rail (HSR), and Ground High Speed Rail (GHSR).
HSR: High Speed Rail. The elevated component of the High Speed Rail Project (HSRP). It is a Monorail-based override network built from a starter piece. It is primarily cosmetic in effect. GHSR: Ground High Speed Rail. The ground-level component of the High Speed Rail Project (HSRP). It is a Monorail-based override network built from a starter piece. IID: Instance ID. See TGI.
MAVE: Medianless Avenue (deprecated). A Medianless Avenue is a network that maintains a lane count of 4 or greater (equalling or exceeding that of the game\u0026rsquo;s default Avenue), but has a narrow, painted division between opposing directions of traffic. The MAVE networks that were included in the Network Widening Mod (NWM) have since been redesignated as \u0026ldquo;Road\u0026rdquo; networks (RD-4, RD-6, and NRD-4).
MHO: Maxis Highway Override. A reskin of the Maxis Highway network (sometimes called \u0026ldquo;Project Symphony\u0026rdquo;), which redesigns the network to resemble the RHW-4, with two lanes in each direction (instead of the three narrower lanes on the default Maxis Highway), and interfaces with the RHW\u0026rsquo;s Modular Interchange System and its own prefabs, rather than using the standard Maxis Highway interchanges.
MHW: Maxis Highway. A term sometimes used to refer to the game\u0026rsquo;s default Elevated and Ground Highway networks, often in contradistinction to the RealHighway (RHW) system.
MIS: Modular Interchange System. This term has a dual meaning. The MIS is generically used to refer to the RealHighway (RHW) system\u0026rsquo;s capabilities to build modular interchanges, as opposed to the pre-fabricated plop interchanges of the Maxis Highway system. More specifically, it is also used to refer to the \u0026ldquo;MIS Ramp\u0026rdquo;, single-lane, one-way RealHighway-based override network, built from starter pieces, and is most often used to connect RealHighways to surface streets or other larger RealHighways. Since NAM 43, the MIS system has been expanded to feature MIS-2, a 2-lane and single tile footprint variant of the MIS, used as a type of turning lane for interchanges connecting to surface road networks.
MRC: Multi-Radius Curve. These are a more recent iteration of Wide Radius Curves (WRCs), which are FLEX-based (and in some cases with smaller radii, draggable), and allow for smoother curves and bends than the game\u0026rsquo;s defaults for supported networks. As the name implies, MRCs come in multiple radii, usually specified with an \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; number (R1, R2, etc.), with larger \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; numbers referring to wider radii.
MTA: Mass Transit Authority. Working group within the Network Addon Mod team, it specializes on defining and applying standards for transit-enabled lots, and oversees NAM projects involving TE lots.
NREE: Nicole Richie Effect Eliminators. Early codename for RHW Neighbor Connectors.
NSGID: Network-Specific Group ID. A Group ID (GID) for exemplar files, which is specific for a given network.
NWM: Network Widening Mod. The Network Widening Mod is an expanded network family which uses draggable overrides for various Road and One-way Road configurations with the use of starter pieces. Each override network varies in width, capacity, and appearance. Network Widening networks are often referred to in a shorthand based on their type and number of lanes they have (e.g. TLA-5, OWR-3). Most NWM networks do have higher capacities compared to the networks upon which they are based, except for OWR-1 and RD-4. These capacity increases are provided through Distilled Intersection Paths (DIPs) or crossover paths whenever traffic must be distributed between more than one tile in the same direction.
ARD: asymmetrical road. This network uses a 3-lane cross-section, with one direction having 2 lanes and the opposite having the remaining lane. In realistic scenarios, the extra lane can be used for intersection approach queuing or used in alternating directions to provide extra capacity without using 4 lanes. The NWM currently has ARD-3 as an asymmetrical cross-section network, while the RHW has RHW-3 as its rural express road counterpart. AVE: avenue. These networks provide a hard or landscaped median fully separating opposite traffic directions. By default, SimCity 4 Rush Hour and SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition bring the 4-lane Avenue (AVE-4), while the NWM provides the AVE-2 (single tile, 2 lanes total) and AVE-6 (triple tile, 6 lanes total). OWR: one-way road. These networks have all their lanes travel in the same direction on a single pavement surface. By default, SimCity 4 Rush Hour and SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition bring the 2-lane One-way Road (OWR-2), while the NWM provides OWR-1, OWR-3 (single tile with 1 and 3 lanes, respectively), OWR-4 and OWR-5 (double tile with 4 and 5 lanes, respectively). RD and NRD: road and narrow road. These networks have a conventional bidirectional lane configuration. The original SimCity games bring the 2-lane road (RD-2) by default, while the NWM provides the 4-lane road (RD-4, dual tile with 4 lanes), the 6-lane road (RD-6, double tile with 6 lanes) and the narrow 4-lane road (NRD-4, single tile with 4 lanes and minimal sidewalks). These were formerly known as medianless avenues (MAVE). TLA: turning lane avenue. These networks use a paved median which separates turning maneuvers from the through travel lanes, allowing easier access to buildings while reducing traffic congestion on the travel lanes. The NWM currently has TLA-3 (single tile, 3 lanes total), TLA-5 (double tile, 5 lanes total) and TLA-7 (triple tile, 7 lanes total). OWR: One-Way Road. An abbreviation used not only to refer to the game\u0026rsquo;s default One-Way Road network (sometimes called \u0026ldquo;OWR-2\u0026rdquo; in this short hand, because it has 2 lanes), but also the single-tile 1-lane (OWR-1) and 3-lane (OWR-3), and dual-tile 4-lane (OWR-4) and 5-lane (OWR-5) variants, included in the Network Widening Mod, as One-Way Road-based override networks built from starter pieces.
PedMall: Pedestrian Mall. A type of puzzle piece designed to carry only pedestrian traffic.
Puzzle Piece: A static, ploppable network item, which can take on a variety of forms. The term was first introduced in NAM 4, to refer to the breakup of the original ploppable overpasses into smaller, modular chunks, which could be reassembled, like a puzzle. Puzzle pieces were, for many years, a staple of NAM development, but since NAM 31, have been in the process of deprecation, in favor of FLEX Pieces and draggable items.
PRM, PedRev: Pedestrian Revolution Mod. This network family encompasses all future FLEX and draggable network features intended for active transportation modes, including pedestrian, cycling and true multimodal corridors. It launched in NAM 45 with the FLEX-based mid-block crosswalks (MBC).
MBC: Mid-block crosswalk. Mid-block crosswalks are a type of pedestrian crossing facility placed away from intersections of surface road networks (in the NAM: Road, OWR, AVE, SAM, NWM and FTL), providing dedicated crossing locations along longer city blocks, at the entrance of large buildings and transit stations, or where pedestrian routes intersect a roadway. These were first introduced in NAM 45 in FLEX form, although older puzzle piece-based prototypes were created but never reached completion. RABET: Roundabout Extension Tiles. This is the name for a set of puzzle piece roundabouts with Network Widening Mod (NWM) compatibility, supporting all double-tile bidirectional NWM variants (RD-4, TLA-5, RD-6), ARD-3 and AVE-4. These feature conventional and turbo roundabouts.
RAM: Railway Addon Mod. An older rail network expansion which formed part of the NAM until version NAM 36, since deprecated in favor of full development of the RealRailway. This railway specification matched the appearance and functionality of the Rail network as originally developed by Maxis. Some NAM railway terms originated in its development:
STR: Single Track Rail. Railway using a single track for two-way traffic. DTR: Dual Track Rail. An acronym sometimes used to refer to the game\u0026rsquo;s default Rail network, particularly in the context of the extended networks included in the Railway Addon Mod (RAM) and later the RealRailway (RRW). TTR: Triple Track Rail. Railway using three tracks for two-way traffic. QTR: Quadruple Track Rail. Railway using four tracks for two way traffic, with two tracks on each side going in the same direction. RD: Road.
REW: RealExpressway. A feature which adds ramp interfaces / branches to the One-Way Road network, in both draggable and FLEX piece form.
RHSR: Real High Speed Rail. A future replacement for the existing High Speed Rail Project (HSRP), designed to the same specifications as the RealRailway (RRW) and Hybrid Railway (HRW), and designed to interface with HRW.
RHW: RealHighway (formerly Rural Highway, before late-2009). The RealHighway system is a NAM network family providing full-scale freeway or motorway functionality. It is based upon an unfinished network (\u0026ldquo;DirtRoad\u0026rdquo;) that Maxis left in the game\u0026rsquo;s files, and was reactivated by the NAM Team in 2004-2005. It currently consists of a series of variable-width highways (ranging from 2 to 10 lanes) with the ability to have variable-width medians, built from starter pieces, and uses modular construction techniques to construct interchanges, rather than the pre-fabricated plop interchanges of the default Maxis Highways. RealHighways are connected to surface streets (Roads, One-Way Roads and Avenues) and other RealHighways through Ramp Interfaces. Transitions between different widths and ground and elevated networks are accomplished through Transition Pieces. RealHighway networks are often referred to in a short hand based on the number of lanes they have in a symmetrical setup allowing for travel in both directions, for example, RHW-2, RHW-4. Networks beyond the RHW-4 often are classified as either being C-type or S-type (e.g. RHW-6C, RHW-8S). C-type networks are \u0026ldquo;combined\u0026rdquo;, and the two travel directions cannot be separated like S-type (\u0026ldquo;separable\u0026rdquo;) networks. Other important terms within the RealHighway network family are the following:
DDI: Diverging Diamond Interchange. A type of interchange popularized by American traffic engineer Gilbert Chlewicki, which resembles a standard diamond interchange, but flips the driving directions between the freeway connections along the surface street, to allow smoother movement of cross-turning traffic. The RealHighway system includes pieces to construct DDIs, which, in-game, have a higher capacity than standard diamond interchanges. DDRHW: Double-Decker Real Highway. This term refers to a special class of elevated highway viaducts consisting of two viaduct decks, each of them carrying traffic in one direction in a compact manner. As part of the RealHighway, only the 4-lane Double-Decker Real Highway (DDRHW-4) is available. DRI: Draggabble Ramp Interface (see RI below). FLEXFly: Flexible Flyover. A series of special FLEX Piece flyover ramps included in the RealHighway system. It is ploppable, but unlike a standard puzzle piece, is overrideable like a draggable item, as all FLEX Pieces are. FLEX-HT: FLEX height transitions. This refers to the general type of height transition, consisting of an inclined viaduct connecting two different network elevations of the same width. These come in orthogonal, diagonal and curved forms (45°, 90°, 180°, and 270° for MHO only). FLEX-NC: FLEX neighbor connectors. This refers to FLEX pieces made to accommodate bidirectional traffic across multi-tile RHW neighbor connections. By default, the game does not support neighbor connection traffic in one direction on single tile bidirectional networks. These pieces provide an underground path configuration by re-arranging the unidirectional paths into separate bidirectional path configurations on each network tile at the neighbor connection. FLEX-OST: FLEX on-slope height transitions. This refers to a special type of height transition placed across a cliff separating two areas of flat terrain. FlexSPUI: Flexible Single-Point Urban Interchange. A special FLEX Piece included in the RealHighway system, designed to allow for the construction of Single Point Urban Interchanges, which resemble standard diamond interchanges, but with the ramps meeting in the center to form a single intersection. It is ploppable, but unlike a puzzle piece, is overrideable like a draggable item, as all FLEX Pieces are. As of NAM 44, FlexSPUI supports FTL-120 and 220 at ground level, and FTL-120 for L1 (7.5m) and L2 (15.0m) configurations, for all RealHighway networks, and Avenue and RD-4 as the surface roadway networks. FLEX-WT: FLEX width transitions. This refers to FLEX pieces made to accommodate widening and narrowing of RHW override networks, while circumventing the auto-connect property of RHW end stubs. QC: QuickChange. A FLEX piece designed to combine a Ramp Interface with a Height Transition, to make interchange construction quicker. The name is a portmanteau of \u0026ldquo;quick\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;interchange\u0026rdquo;. QCX: QuickChange Xpress. A full, ploppable, FLEX-based RHW interchange. The first QCXs were introduced in NAM 45. RI: Ramp Interface. These are geometric configurations used for freeway, motorway and expressway ramps, including the RealHighway (RHW), the Maxis Highway Override (MHO), the RealExpressway, and the Avenue. These come in draggable form (DRI-draggable ramp interface), FLEX piece (FLEX Ramps) and puzzle pieces (in process of deprecation). RRW: RealRailway. The NAM\u0026rsquo;s default modernized specification for the Rail network, in contrast to the standard Maxis Rail specification. This standard consists of revised realistic geometry, FLEX piece support (FLEXtrack), and a vast expansion of draggable geometries.
RTL: Road Turning Lanes. A deprecated NAM feature, which adds turn lanes to +-intersections and T-intersections between two orthogonal Roads.
RTMT: Road-Top Mass Transit. The Road-Top Mass Transit is a TE lot project which creates an assortment of bus, subway, GLR and multimodal combinations of these transit services for placement atop transportation networks, as opposed to requiring space away from networks. This project is managed by members of the NAM team, but published separately.
RUL: Network Rule File. Network rules are the code used to define the placement, interaction and override of both transportation (anything road or rail) and utility networks (water pipes). There are several types of RUL code, three of which are unified, and various others which operate on a per-network basis.
BridgeRUL: A type of Network Rule (RUL) file used to handle the layout of bridges. This RUL type comes in two flavors: the simple viaduct style, which only defines abutments (ends of the bridge connecting to land), piers (intermediate supports) and spans (bridge segments between consecutive supports); and the elaborate style, which defines main and approach spans typical of large bridge configurations, such as suspension, cable-stay, large arches, and large truss structures. INRUL: Individual Network Rule File. A type of Network Rule (RUL) File, used to handle the placement of individual networks, including intersections of the given network with itself. All INRULs lie in the IID range between 0x00000001 and 0x00000018. RUL0: Shorthand for the RUL with the instance ID 0x10000001, the IntersectionOrdering RUL. This RUL type defines pre-fabricated network pieces, using either definitions done only within this type of code, which yields puzzle pieces, or summoning definitions made in INRUL or RUL1, yielding FLEX pieces. RUL1: Shorthand for the RUL with the instance ID 0x10000001, the IntersectionSolutions RUL. This RUL type defines any and all situations in which two different base networks overlap, including real intersections, transitions between compatible networks, and invalid definitions used as seeds for other configurations (false intersections / falsies). RUL2: Shorthand for the RUL with the Instance ID 0x10000002, the NetworkOverrides RUL, which is used in the creation of \u0026ldquo;override networks\u0026rdquo;. It works by comparing any pair of network pieces programmed in INRUL or RUL1, considering their orientation (rotation and mirroring), and assigning either a new configuration (override), stabilizing an override configuration (adjacency stability) or blocking the configuration from existing (prevent line). RuRP: Rural Roads Plugin. This is a small option using puzzle pieces to construct roads with a narrow footprint and striped appearance, or a dirt road appearance based on SAM-3 and SAM-4 (PEG dirt and PEG gravel streets).
SAM: Street Addon Mod. The Street Addon Mod is a set of cosmetic overrides for the Street Network, featuring parking lots (SAM-1), dirt/gravel streets (SAM-3, 4, 5), alternative pavement styles (SAM-7, 10 and 11) and brick/cobblestone styles (SAM-2, 6, 8 and 9).
SIP: Signalized Intersection Piece.
SITAP: Signalized Intersection and Turn Arrow Project. SITAP uses draggable and FLEX Piece-based functionality to allow working traffic signals on intersections involving networks that, due to the game\u0026rsquo;s hardcoded limitations, can\u0026rsquo;t otherwise support them, including the One-Way Road network and some of the smaller RealHighway (RHW) networks.
SLURP: Station Locator, Updater and Reconstruction Project. This is a project conducted by the Mass Transit Authority (MTA), a working group within the NAM team specialized on TE lot standards. It consists of editing the TE lot programming (transit switches, paths, capacity, etc.) of existing transit lots published separately from the NAM and RTMT, and then overriding their TE lot programming through the NAM installer. This feature was supported from NAM 32 to NAM 36 under the NSIS installer, plans exist to re-implement the SLURP functionality for a future revision of the NAM installer.
SPM: Signage Piece Mod.
T-RAM: Tram-Road Addon Mod. This is a dual network family consisting of Elevated Rail in representation of tram networks and various surface road networks, including Street, Road and Avenue.
TIA: Tram (GLR)-in-Avenue TIR: Tram (GLR)-in-Road. This Road/El-Rail dual network uses tram tracks separating two road lanes, such that road traffic doesn\u0026rsquo;t overlap with the tram tracks. TOR: Tram (GLR)-on-Road. This Road/El-Rail dual network uses tram tracks placed atop two road lanes, in a four-lane cross-section (comparable to NRD-4 - 4-lane narrow road), such that road vehicles can travel atop tram tracks. TOS: Tram (GLR)-on-Street T21: Type 21 Exemplar. This exemplar controls the placement patterns of network props, including landscaping, signs, streetlights, traffic signals, pillars of elevated networks, barriers, railway catenaries and certain types of pavement markings
TE Lots: Transit-Enabled Lots. These are ploppable lots with a transportation function, including bus stops, rail stations, freight yards, multimodal stations, ferry terminals, seaports, parking lots, parking garages and toll booths. These involve the programming of various properties, including capacity, fares, network paths, transit switches (definitions of which transit types can go in the lot, and how they move or change from one to another) and construction/maintenance costs.
TGI: Type-Group-Instance IDs. These are hexadecimal values SimCity 4 uses to define and identify the different asset types used throughout the game.
TID: Type ID. A hexadecimal identified to specify the file format of a given game asset. As an example, a PNG image, which can be used as an icon within a menu.
GID: Group ID. A hexadecimal identifier designed to specify the function of a given game asset within the game context. As an example, a GID used to define whether the asset is used for a texture-based network or a model-based network.
NSGID: Network-Specific Group ID. A Group ID (GID) for exemplar files, which is specific for a given network.
IID: Instance ID. A hexadecimal number used to identify a specific network piece, exemplar, RUL file, etc. Items using different type and group ID values are used in unison if they share the same instance ID values. Conflicts between mods can arise if two unrelated items of the same type and group share the same instance ID values.
TuLEP: Turning Lane Extension Piece(s) (or Project). This is a set of puzzle pieces used to create intersections with turning lanes and slip lanes. These were made for Road, Avenue, some bidirectional NWM networks, RHW-2 and RHW-3. They have since been superseded by the FLEX Turn Lanes (FTLs), first introduced in NAM 36 and substantially expanded from NAM 43 to 45.
URail: Underground Rail. A series of puzzle piece-based items allowing for underground functionality of the Rail network, both with and without Dual-Networking functionality (i.e. URail-under-Road). Developed by GoaSkin, and later by Chrisim, it debuted in NAM 20.
WAVERide: Wave Override\u0026ndash;deprecated term to refer to what is now known as a FLEX Piece.
WRC: Wide Radius Curve. These are network configurations available in draggable, FLEX and/or puzzle piece form, which replace the sharp 45° and 90° bends achievable with simple drag patterns of networks. These allow players to get smoother and more realistic roadway and railway geometric alignments. See also MRC.
Acronyms sometimes confused for being Network Addon Mod-related:
CAM: Colossus Addon Mod, which is not transit-related at all, but rather, a mod dealing with RCI simulation, which adds additional stages to growables. The original version featured its own traffic simulator, since deprecated and superseded by the NAM traffic simulator. SPAM: SimPeg Agricultural Mod, which is not transit-related at all, but rather, a mod dealing with the farming and agriculture. The original version featured its own traffic simulator, since deprecated and superseded by the NAM traffic simulator. `}),e.add({id:6,href:"/docs/reference/nam-version-history/",title:"NAM Version History",description:"NAM Version History",content:"Agile Releases (2020 and later) # Version 47 (27 March 2023) # Pedestrian Revolution Mod Features: The NAM Team is pleased to present the Classic Draggable Pedmalls, courtesy of Ulisse Wolf and Lucario Boricua. These come in 8 styles, 6 of which are equivalents to the Pedmall Puzzle Pieces, and introducing 2 new designs: the Retrowave Red Brick, inspired in the old brick texture used for the U-Rail in earlier NAM versions, and the Industrial Style, using the concrete surface typical of industrial lots. The initially supported features of these pedmalls include: Multidirectional draggable starter pieces using the Street network, supporting all orthogonal, diagonal, intersection and roundabout configurations, with the exception of wide radius curves. Intersection support (OXO T and 4-way) in the form of mid-block crosswalks. These support Road, Avenue, and all two-way Network Widening Mod override networks (TLA-3, AVE-2, ARD-3, NRD-4, TLA-5, RD-4, RD-6, TLA-7 and AVE-6). These draggable pedmalls are also compatible with the FLEX mid-block crosswalk pieces. Special underground paths enable residential zone development, while crossings discourage car traffic through restricted car paths. In addition, some enhancements to existing functionality have been implemented: The override code for the size 3 mid-block crosswalks for TLA-7 and AVE-6 have been overhauled, enabling these to be overridden from one side. RealHighway (RHW) Features: RHW-12S: A new, 12-lane quadruple-tile RHW network (separable into two dual-tile halves, carrying 6 lanes in each direction) has been added, with the following features: Three height levels are supported: L0/Ground, L1/7.5-meter elevation, and L2/15-meter elevation. Transitioning between these height levels is supported by the ramp-style FLEX Height Transitions (FLEX-HT), as well as the FLEX OnSlope Transitions (FLEX-OSTs), by connecting them to the RHW-12S networks. The RHW-12S features the same network crossings presently available to the other S-Type RHW networks, including crossings in all orientations for all Maxis base networks, all other RHW networks, Draggable Ground Light Rail, and Draggable Road Viaducts (L0-under-Viaduct-only), plus Orthogonal x Orthogonal (OxO)-only support for Network Widening Mod networks, Elevated RealRailway (ERRW) Viaducts, Tram-on-Street, Tram-in-Road, and Tram-in-Avenue. Limited Hybrid Railway (HRW) support also exists. Extensive ramp interface support: supported ramps using FLEXRamps and Draggable Ramp Interfaces (when applicable) include Orthogonal Type A1 (all levels), Type B1 (all levels), Type D1 (all levels), Type E1 (all levels), Type A2 (all levels), Type B2 (L0 only), Type D2 (all levels), Type E2 (L0 only), Type A1-Inside (all levels), Type B1-Inside (all levels), Type D1-Inside (L0 only), Type E1-Inside (L0 only), the new Type A3 (L0 only) and Type D3 (L0 only), plus Diagonal Type A1 (L0 only), Type B1 (L0 only), Type D1 (L0 only), and Type E1 (L0 only). FLEX Width Transition (FLEX-WT) has been added, to support width transitions between RHW-12S and RHW-10S at all applicable height levels. FLEXFly over and undercrossings are supported with the RHW-12S (orthogonal-only, as diagonal undercrossings for FLEXFly do not presently exist for any network). Several bridges have been added (see Bridge section). Support for FlexSPUI is presently limited, and Three-Level Crossings are not yet supported. RHW X3 Ramps: The first two FLEX 3-lane ramps, in A3 and D3 configurations, have been provided for RHW-8S, 10S and 12S. At present, only L0 support is available. General Improvements Some enhancements, courtesy of memo, have been made to facilitate FLEXFly-over-FLEXFly functionality. Some enhancements, courtesy of Flann, to elevated RHW network models have been added. Various adjacencies involving RHW x RHW crossings next to the base orth-diag curve on the smaller networks (RHW-6S and smaller) have been addressed. Bridges: A multitude of new bridges have been added, courtesy of IDS2 and Kitsune: New viaduct bridges for L0 RHW-8S, L0 RHW-10S and L0-L2 RHW-12S. A pair of new Steel Arch bridges for RHW-10S and RHW-12S. Base Network Features: A new 5x5 90° Wide Radius Curve FLEX piece has been added to the Avenue network. Miscellaneous: A huge number of bugfixes have been done for this release, including: Various RHW situations involving \u0026ldquo;tile drops\u0026rdquo;, such as the RHW-8S-to-6S FLEX Width Transitions, the RHW-8S Type D1, E1, and B2 ramps, and the RHW-10S Type D2 and E2 ramps, have received considerable stability upgrades. The orientation of the Road end-T on OWR-1 intersection has been corrected. The orientations of certain NWM intersections involving the OWR-1 network with Euro textures have been corrected. Stability improvements have been made to the Ground Light Rail crossings with various wider RHW networks. The Dual Type 230 QCXs with L1 Dual Type 230-over-RHW-8C/6C and RHW-10S/8S have been improved. Issues in which lane drop arrows appeared in the wrong places on the S-to-C FLEX Width Transitions have been corrected. The ramp textures for the RHW-10S Type D2 and E2 ramps, as well as for the RHW-8S Type A2-Wide and B2 ramps have been improved. Orientation and stability issues have been fixed with the Avenue-based AVE-6 and its Thru-T-intersections with Street, Road, and One-Way Road (both Short-T and Long-T). Orthogonal x Diagonal slip lanes involving Road and One-way Road (OWR) have been re-implemented. Several hundred path files across all areas of the NAM have been fixed by memo and Tarkus. More SAM Street crossings with the Rail network have received crossing gates. Euro wealth textures have been added to the Avenue-based AVE-6 network. Version 46 (15 January 2023) (SC4 20th Anniversary) # Network Widening Mod (NWM) Features: Support for diagonal 4-way (+) intersections and crossings has been added for all six single-tile NWM networks (TLA-3, AVE-2, ARD-3, OWR-1, OWR-3, and NRD-4), including orthogonal X diagonal (OXD), diagonal X orthogonal (DXO) and diagonal X diagonal (DXD). These networks may cross one another, along with all base Maxis networks, Ground Light Rail (GLR), and Single-Track Rail (STR). Support for 3-way intersections, other NAM network families (i.e. RHW, SAM, etc.), and those involving multi-tile NWM networks will be added in a future phase. A preliminary version of an Avenue-based form of the 6-lane Avenue (AVE-6) network has been added, which supports full wealthing. To build an AVE-6 with the Avenue tool, overlap two orthogonal Avenues, and they will convert (diagonals are not presently supported). Most intersections supported by the existing AVE-6 are supported with this new implementation, and it is also possible to transition to the traditional Road-based AVE-6 for any functionality not yet supported. Network Widening Mod (NWM) Features: Over 20 new Bridges have been added, courtesy of IDS2, including the first Bridges for the OWR-4 and OWR-5 networks (which are Avenue-based Bridges, due to the side-by-side Bridge limitation). Further bridge support has been added for RD-4, RD-6, SAM-6 (Klinker Streets), SAM-11 (MGB Industial), Double-Track Rail (DTR) and Single Track Rail (STR). Hybrid Railway (HRW) Features: L2 HRW support has been added, along with LHD improvements, and a reimplementation of the OnSlope Transitions to improve slope handling. Elevated support includes R2 elevated curves (at L1 and L2), orthogonal X orthogonal (OXO) crossings with the base road networks (Road, OWR, Avenue), the Network Widening Mod and the RealHighway, and diagonal X orthogonal (DXO) includes the base road networks and the RealHighway. Rail Slope Settings: An improved set of Rail Slope Settings has been prepared, providing more user choice and greater usability with the smoother/more restrictive options. Base Network Features: Courtesy of the recently-returned Shadow Assassin, the diagonal transitions between the Avenue network and the Road and RHW-2 networks have been dramatically improved, and extended versions have been added. Direct connection transitions were re-designed for a smoother look, and the new extended versions use a stub-to-stub override. In preparation for future phases of the NWM diagonal intersection expansion, the base T-intersections involving diagonal Road and/or One-Way Road have been revamped. RealHighway (RHW) Features: The long-awaited Dual Type 230 QuickChange Xpress Diamond Interchange setups are now available, which allow one to quickly build pre-fabricated interchanges between various RealHighway (RHW) networks and the triple-tile NWM networks, complete with turn lanes and all the bells and whistles. The Diagonal Ramp-Style FLEX Height Transitions now support RHW-3 and RHW-6S. The Double-Decker RHW-4 (DDRHW-4) models have been revamped, courtesy of Ulisse, coupled with some improvements to base functionality. The Type E1-Inside ramps now have elevated forms, and various incremental improvements have been made to the elevated ramp interface models. The Type A2 and B2 merging ramps have been re-designed to feature a lane drop prior to connecting with the mainline lanes. A new FLEX Width Transition piece has been added, to better facilitate transitions involving multi-tile S-type networks (especially the previously unstable RHW-8S-to-6S transitions, with their tile drop). The MIS 2-Lane FLEX Turn Lanes (including the FLEX Height Transition) can now connect smoothly to FlexSPUI and FlexDDI. FLEX Turn Lane (FTL) Streetlights: The FLEX Turn Lane (FTL) setups (except the very limited Avenue Type 020) now support streetlights. New NAM Website: An official Network Addon Mod website has been launched, https://www.sc4nam.com, featuring NAM documentation and feature guides. NAM Lite: NAM Lite has now been spun off as a standalone download. Version 45 (8 September 2022) # Traffic Simulator Updates: The NAM Traffic Simulator has been upgraded to Simulator Z 3.0, resulting in further optimizations to both the speed and accuracy of the simulation, and improved network utilization. The Low capacity version of the simulator is now the recommended version, as it provides the most optimized simulation. The Traffic Volume View Plugins have also been updated. The Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT) has been discontinued and is no longer supported, as it was designed to work with the 2.x releases of Simulator Z, and because of the nature of the changes in the 3.0 release. Ploppable Interchanges for the RealHighway (RHW) System: The initial QuickChange Xpress (QCX) ploppable interchanges for the RHW have been incorporated, featuring 16 Road and Avenue Diamond Interchanges, which are FLEX-based, adding to their ease-of-use and post-plop customization potential. The QCX interchanges are at the end of the RHW QuickChange menu button on the Highways Menu. Pedestrian Revolution Mod (PRM) Midblock Crosswalks: The initial phase of the new Pedestrian Revolution Mod (PRM, or PedRev), spearheaded by developer Lucario Boricua has been added, featuring Midblock Crosswalk options for Roads, Avenues, and the two-way Network Widening Mod (NWM) override networks, in three sizes. These crosswalks calm traffic and allow for connections to the NAM\u0026rsquo;s existing Pedestrian Mall (PedMall) features. The Midblock Crossings button can be found on the Roads Menu. NAMLite Package: The initial version of NAMLite, a bite-sized package for users looking for a minimal install has been added to the download, with its own installer. NAMLite Version 1 features the Traffic Simulator, Automata Controllers, bugfixes, One-Way Roads, Roundabouts, Diagonal Streets, and the option to install the Diagonal Street FLEX/Helper Pieces, Avenue Roundabouts, and Additional Highway Interchanges for the Maxis (Elevated) Highway and Ground Highway networks. Hybrid Railway (HRW) Features: L1 Diagonal support has been added, along with a number of new crossings. Left-Hand Driving (LHD) Improvements: The Left-Hand Driving (LHD) functionality of the NAM has been dramatically overhauled and improved, fixing numerous bugs and improving reliability for users playing the game with traffic running on the left side of roads and rails. Note that some RHW ramp interfaces and FLEX transitions may need to be reclicked as a result of their LHD reimplementation. Documentation Upgrades: The documentation has been thoroughly updated and now covers almost all NAM features to at least some extent, with the addition of feature guides for Hybrid Railway (HRW), the Pedestrian Revolution Mod, Ground Light Rail (GLR) and Tram Dual-Networking, the Elevated Road Viaducts, RealExpressway (REW), Utility Items (Network Eraser and Hole Diggers/Raisers), Underground Rail (URail), and the Canal Addon Mod (CAN-AM), alongside an updated glossary page. Euro Texture Optimization: As a result of the large-scale file cleanup effort undertaken following the release of NAM 44 (known as \u0026ldquo;NAM 44X\u0026rdquo;), the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Euro textures largely operate independently, and no longer rely upon overrides of the default US texture set. This has decreased the size of a Euro Texture installation of the NAM by about 300MB, and along with other optimizations, has dropped the size of the NAM download package by about 150MB. New Bridges: A plethora of new bridges designed by IDS2 have been added this release: Walnut Street (V-Shaped Girder) Bridges: Support for Road, Street, One-Way Road, SAM Sets 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, RHW-2, and RHW-4. Antheor Viaduct (Brick Arch Viaduct) Bridges: Support for RealRailway (RRW) Dual-Track Rail (DTR) and Single-Track Rail (STR). Additionally, the existing Cable-Stayed Bridge has been ported to cover Ground Light Rail (GLR). Additional RealExpressway Ramps: New Road-to-OWR-1 splits have been added to the RealExpressway Mod, and can be found at the end of the RealExpressway Ramps button on the Roads Menu. RHW MIS Ramp and FLEX Turn Lane Additions: L1 support for MIS 2-Lane FLEX Turn Lanes (FTLs) has been added, including a new combination upward height/width transition. Additionally, network support for the MIS 2-Lane FTLs has been improved, along with the ability to use the same draggable method used on the One-Way Roads (via transition to Road prior to an intersection) for SITAP (Signalized Intersection and Turn Arrow Project) support has been incorporated. The 3x3 90° Curves for the MIS have also been ported to L1-L4 elevations. RHW Model Improvements: Courtesy of Flann, the elevated versions of the RHW-6C and RHW-8C now feature a single median barrier, matching their ground counterparts, and eliminating the previous gap between the two halves/carriageways of the highways. Additionally, the elevated versions of the 2x2 MIS Short 90° Curves have also received further optimization. New barrier and pillar textures by Bipin have also been incorporated to coincide with these changes. Italian Translation: As a result of the efforts of ulisse99, the entirety of the NAM has been translated into Italian. Other Bugfixes: The level crossings for Ground Light Rail (GLR) and RealRailway (RRW) have been properly color-corrected. Adjacency issues involving the RHW-8S Type D1 and Type D1-Inside ramps have been addressed. 3x3 Street circles have been stabilized and modified to use a smoother blend curve. The Ground Light Rail (GLR) pathing on the ulisse Transit Stations has been fixed. The rotation of some intersections involving OWR-3 (esp. OWR-3 x AVE-2 +) has been corrected. Various issues with the Maxis Highway and Maxis Highway Override crossings with the RealHighway (RHW) system have been addressed. Fixes have been applied to the Elevated Light Rail and Monorail versions of the Cable-Stayed Bridge, the Steel Arch Rail Bridge, the High Elevated (30m) Monorail Bridge, and the L1/L2 RHW-8S and RHW-10S Viaduct Bridges. Some stop point issues causing some signals on AVE-6 intersections with Avenue to remain permanently green have been addressed. The model for the SimGoober-Style Canal Station in the Canal Addon Mod (CAN-AM) plugin has been fixed by Tyberius06. Version 44 (22 March 2022) # Hybrid Railway (HRW) Features: The Hybrid Railway system now features FA-2 Alt content, new textures to blend with the RealRailway (RRW) system, improvements to catenaries, and major improvements to Left-Hand Drive [LHD] support. RealHighway (RHW) x Avenue Features: The RealHighway (RHW) now has a FlexDDI system, allowing for FLEX-based Diverging Diamond interchanges with the Avenue network at ground level, and L1 and L2 elevations. Additionally, the FlexSPUI system now supports the L1 height level for the Type 120/Avenue configuration, along with stability improvements for all height levels. Both of these FLEX-based items can be found under a new button on the Roads menu. Additionally, the Avenue Type A1 and B1 MIS Ramp Interfaces have received draggable forms, following the same basic drag patterns as the RHW Type A1 and B1 Ramp Interfaces. RealHighway (RHW) Curves: new 90° draggable Mini-Curves have been added. The new 3x3 R1 90° Curves support the ground-level RHW-2, RHW-3, RHW-4, and MIS Ramp networks. The new 4x4 R1.5 90° Curves support the ground-level RHW-2, RHW-3, RHW-4, RHW-6S, and MIS Ramp networks. The RHW-6S also now supports the 5x5 R2 90° Curve configuration. MIS Ramp network support has been added to the FLEX S-Curve, and minor aesthetic improvements have been made to the L1 and above RHW-4 FLEX S-Curves. RealHighway (RHW) Transitions: 45° Curved FLEX Height Transitions at the R3 radius have been added, covering the RHW-2 (L0-L1), RHW-4 (L0-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4), and MIS Ramp (L0-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4) networks. Diagonal FLEX OnSlope (FLEX-OST) support has been added for the RHW-3 and RHW-6S networks. Additionally, further adjacency stability has been added to the 4x4 90° Curved FLEX Height Transitions. Bridges: New Viaduct Bridges have been added for Avenue (L0, L1, and L2), RHW-8S and RHW-10S (L1 and L2), and RealRailway (L0, L1, L2 for double track, L0 and L1 for single track). Flexible Turn Lane (FTL) Features: FLEX-based FTL Height Transitions have been added, including for the Type 120 Avenue (Ascending, L0-L1 and L0-L2\u0026ndash;use the FLEX Pieces for ramp-style transitions, or drag the FTL setup into the ground end of the On-Slope Transitions to transition the turn lanes to elevation), and RealHighway MIS-2 Lane (Descending, L1-L0, with FLEX Pieces for ramp-style transitions) configurations. Limited L1 and L2 Type 120 Avenue FTL support has been added (primarily for connecting to the L1 and L2 FlexSPUI). The Type 230 configuration for the Triple-Tile Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks has received draggable support for rail-type crossings, including Rail (both Dual and Single-Track), L1 and L2 Rail Viaducts, Standard and Rural Ground Light Rail (GLR), Elevated (Light) Rail, and Monorail. The MIS 2-Lane configuration has also received support for Avenue + and T-intersections (without FTLs), and One-Way Road intersections (with SITAP\u0026ndash;Signalization and Turn Arrow Project\u0026ndash;support, using the appropriate FLEX intersections). Additionally, Avenues can now end at T-intersections with the Road/NWM Type 110 configuration, with turn arrows provided by the new Avenue Type 020 FTLs. Streets and the Street Addon Mod (SAM): The draggable Diagonal S-Curves now work for SAM Sets 2 through 11. Network Widening Mod (NWM) x Street Addon Mod (SAM): Adjacency support for the Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks\u0026rsquo; intersections with the Street Addon Mod (SAM) sets has been vastly improved. FLEX Overpasses: The Road, One-Way Road (OWR), and Avenue networks have now received FLEX Overpasses, which allow for prefabricated orthogonal viaduct overcrossings of 1-4 tiles to be built. The length can be selected by using Home and End to rotate the overpass. Simply drag any orthogonal network underneath the FLEX Overpasses to cross below them. RHW Disconnector/NAM Eraser: The RHW Disconnector Tool has been rechristened the NAM Eraser, reflecting its ability to erase 1x1 network tiles of any network or network crossing combination. Additionally, it is also now available on all network menus. User Interface: The NAM\u0026rsquo;s menu buttons have been reworked, providing a cleaner image and, to improve internationalization (i18n), the English text has been removed from the icons themselves. The buttons have also been reordered, in an effort to improve the overall experience. Additionally, the old puzzle piece-based overpasses have been related to legacy status. Left-Hand Drive Support: Various improvements have been made across the board to LHD pathing. Morifari Victorian Stations: The Morifari Victorian Stations for Elevated Light Rail and Rail Viaducts have been restored, with some associated bugs fixed. Other Bugfixes: The RHW-10S will no longer flip improperly under Elevated RealRailway (ERRW) crossings. Diagonal x Diagonal (DxD) crossings involving the MIS Ramp and RHW-8C network have been improved. Pathing issues on the RHW-6C and RHW-8C FLEX Neighbor Connections have been addressed. Fixed the Euro textures on the RHW-6S Type A2 Wide ramp. The extraneous arrows on the RHW-2-to-4 and RHW-4-to-6C FLEX Width Transitions in LHD have been addressed. Drag-through issues involving the Triple-Tile-Thru x Dual-Tile-End FLEX T-intersections in the Flexible Turn Lanes (FTLs) have been fixed. Version 43 (24 December 2021) # The NAM Traffic Simulator (also known as \u0026ldquo;Simulator Z\u0026rdquo;) has been upgraded to Version 2.6.2, further refining pathfinding. Type 230 FLEX Turn Lanes (FTL) have been added for the triple-tile networks (TLA-7 and AVE-6) in the Network Widening Mod (NWM), allowing for dual left turns (or in Left-Hand Drive [LHD], dual right turns). Use the RealHighway (RHW) network tool to draw the center tile of this new FTL type. Additionally, the FLEX intersections for use with the wider FTL types have been improved. A number of new bridges have been added, including ones supporting the L1 and L2 elevated forms of the Road, One-Way Road, RHW-2, RHW-3, RHW-4, RHW-6S, and MIS Ramp networks . New curved switch, double-track median split (for use with overhanging stations), and L0/L1 \u0026ldquo;basketweave\u0026rdquo; FLEX pieces have been added to the Hybrid Railway (HRW) system, which allows for joint Rail and High Speed Rail (Monorail) traffic. Additionally, the HRW FLEX Height Transitions have been given their own button. Two new transit stations by ulisse99 have been added, the HRW Union Station (for Hybrid Railway) and the GLR Transit Hub (for Light Rail/Tram). Additionally, the transit switches for all recently-added stations have been updated, improving their functionality. The RealHighway (RHW) system has received an initial round of FLEX Turn Lanes (FTLs), covering the RHW-2 (Type 110), RHW-4 (Type 120\u0026ndash;built by overriding the Type 110 transition with an RHW-4), and MIS Ramp (2-Lane) networks. Additionally, FLEX-based SITAP (Signalized Intersection and Turn Arrow Project) support has been added to the base RHW-2 network, with all new FTL intersections (except Street intersections) supporting signalized and unsignalized forms. All such items can be found under the RHW FLEX Turn Lanes button, on the Highways menu. The One-Way Road version of SITAP has been given FLEX intersections and a new FLEX transition/starter (OWR Type 020), which allows the turn lane arrows to be extended by the user. All of these items can be found under the FLEX Turn Lanes button, under the Roads menu. Additionally, Left-Hand Drive (LHD) support for SITAP has been improved. A transition from the Network Widening Mod (NWM)\u0026rsquo;s RD-4 network to the Type 120 FLEX Turn Lanes (FTLs) has been added. A new draggable version of the OWR-3-to-OWR-5 transition in the NWM has been added. Two new FLEX items have been added to the RealRailway (RRW) system: a double-track median split (for use with overhanging stations), and an L1-L2 ramp-style height transition. Additionally, the orthogonal 1-Level FLEX On-Slope now supports L1-L2 transitions. The RealHighway (RHW) FLEX-based Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) in all radii (R1-R5), as well as the FLEX S-Curve, now all support the L0 RHW-3 network. Draggable stub-to-stub Height Transitions have been added for many RHW networks (except the base RHW-2). To construct, click over one of the stubs with the Elevated (Light) Rail tool to prevent the RHW\u0026rsquo;s normal auto-connect behavior, thereby allowing the transition overrides to initiate. An issue causing the old RHW-2, MIS, and RHW-4 Flexible Underpass (FLUPs) Overcrossing Puzzle Pieces (from the Roads x RHW button on the Roads menu) has been addressed. Since this issue was the result of an Instance ID conflict with the new RHW-3 and RHW-4 FLEX FLUPs Portals, any existing RHW-3 and RHW-4 FLEX FLUPs Portal will need to be rebuilt, by simply clicking over the portal with the RHW network tool. Additionally, the preview models for the FLEX-FLUPs Road and One-Way Road Portals have been corrected, and all portals should now function properly in LHD. Some directional flip issues with multi-tile Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks crossing under elevated RealHighway (RHW) networks have been addressed. A conflict between the Road Roundabouts and the Network Widening Mod (NWM) that was preventing T-intersections involving two triple-tile networks has been resolved. An issue in which the \u0026ldquo;strict\u0026rdquo; version of the RealRailway (RRW) Slope Parameters would be installed regardless has been fixed. The streetlight placement on the Draggable Road Viaducts (L1 and L2 Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue) has been improved. Holiday Bonus: A special holiday highway sign by Lucario Boricua is available in the NAM 43 download. Simply move NAM_Christmas_Sign.dat into your Plugins folder and look for the new sign under the Misc Transit Menu to enjoy. Version 42 (24 August 2021) # The long-awaited 3-Level Crossings for the RealHighway (RHW) system have been added. The Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks now have vastly improved stability, including in tight situations. Note that some intersections have been rotated as part of this process, and may appear to be in the wrong position upon loading. Simply clicking these situations with the appropriate network tool with re-orient them. RHW FLEX Width Transitions (FLEX-WTs) are now available, supporting over 200 possible network configurations with only 5 FLEX Pieces, with vastly improved slope tolerance. To use the FLEX-WTs, simply connect the desired networks into each end of the transition. The RHW FLEX Height Transitions (FLEX-HT) have been expanded to include a new 1-Level 90° Curved version, which presently supports L0-L1 RHW-2, L0-L1 MIS, and L0-L1 RHW-4. RHW FLEX Neighbor Connectors (FLEX-NCs) are now available, supporting every RHW network, including the L1-L4 elevated networks. An RHW Basketweave FLEX Piece has been added, allowing for ramp crossings in tight quarters, presently for L0 and L1 RHW-4. An RHW FLEX S-Curve has been added, allowing support for L0-L2 RHW-2 and L0-L4 RHW-4. Draggable Smooth Diagonal S-Curves have been added to the Road, One-Way Road, OWR-1, RHW-2, and MIS networks, along with the ability to make a Street version via the existing Diagonal Street FLEX/Helper Pieces. The Road Roundabouts have been overhauled, with revamped textures, a new center island prop, and support for new intersection combinations with Road, Street, One-Way Road, RHW-2, and MIS. The NAM\u0026rsquo;s Bridge system has undergone a revamp, with a new file architecture, a new OWR-3 Thru Truss bridge, various cosmetic fixes for bridges at various lengths, and pathing corrections to the RHW-6S Compact Box Girder. Several new large, multi-line stations for the Hybrid Railway (HRW) and RealRailway (RRW) networks have been added. The Diagonal Streets textures have been revamped. Stop-controlled \u0026ldquo;rural\u0026rdquo; intersections have been added: Road x Road +, Road x Road T, Avenue x Road +, Avenue x Road T (Avenue-Thru/Road-End), FTL Type 110 x Road +, and FTL Type 110 x Road T (FTL-Thru/Road-End). To add stop control, transition a Road to Street one tile before an intersection, and then cross/intersect it with Street. Limited support was provided for these in previous recent releases, and any such existing intersections will need to be rebuilt. A long-standing issue with the RHW-8S Type E1 ramps, when overridden from the bottom of the ramp, has been corrected. The Canal Addon Mod (CAN-AM) now has improved automata generation, as well as improvements to station functionality. The RRW Slope and Tunnel Parameters section now has three options: Maxis Default (which now changes the tunnel models to match the RRW), Moderate (the new default), and Strict (the only option previously). Various stability issues with the ERRW Viaduct crossings with RHW networks have been addressed. A shell script has been added to the installation package, to improve the user experience on Linux (thanks to Durfsurn. Various LHD path fixes for the RRW and Avenue Roundabouts have been incorporated. The draggable form of the RHW-8S Type D2 Wide ramp has been stabilized. An option to remove \u0026ldquo;legacy\u0026rdquo; RHW menu buttons from the Highways menu has been added, along with general Highways menu improvements. The \u0026ldquo;Compact\u0026rdquo; RHW-6C-to-4 Transition Puzzle Piece has been disabled from the Legacy Width Transitions menu, due to conflict with other items. The Single-Tile Roundabouts have undergone revision, and may need to be rebuilt in existing cities. Version 41 (24 April 2021) # Note: in order to ensure proper installation of NAM releases using the current installer, please remove the \u0026ldquo;Network Addon Mod\u0026rdquo; folder (and if still present, \u0026ldquo;z___NAM\u0026rdquo; folder) from the Plugins directory (usually My Documents\\SimCity 4\\Plugins on Windows) before installing a new NAM version. The Cleanup/Cleanitol functionality is not presently designed to remove full NAM installations. The RealExpressway (REW) system for the One-Way Road network has been reimplemented and expanded. In addition to the previous Draggable Ramp Interfaces (DRIs), new FLEXRamps and Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) have been added, and options for new, more consistent Avenue-style striping for all the One-Way Road networks have been added. The new FLEXRamps available include the Orthogonal and Diagonal OWR-2 Type A1 (Orthogonal overrideable with OWR-1), Orthogonal, Diagonal, and Curved OWR-2 Type B1 (Orthogonal overrideable with OWR-1), Orthogonal and Diagonal OWR-2 Type D1, Orthogonal OWR-3 Type D1, Orthogonal OWR-2 Type E1, and Orthogonal OWR-3 Type E1. MRCs supported include R1-R5 radii for OWR-2, R1-R3 for OWR-1, and R2-R5 for OWR-3. Note that in order to combat hardcoded \u0026ldquo;Tidal Flow\u0026rdquo; issues, the FLEX-based REW items are bidirectionally pathed, and use special network flags that do not allow them to be overplopped on existing stretches of One-Way Road. The SAM-to-SAM and SAM-to-Street Transitions for the Street Addon Mod (SAM) have been revamped, stabilized, and expanded, adding wealth texture support, new support for SAM Set 1, and improved support for SAM Set 11. The new Subway-based FLUPs system has been revamped to be easier to use. New underground starter pieces for the URoad-2, URoad-3, URamp, and URoad-4 (underground equivalents of the RHW-2, RHW-3, MIS, and RHW-4, respectively) have been added, and can be placed directly over top of Subway, allowing the network to be converted with a simple click of the Subway tool afterward. The starters at the ends of the FLUPs Portals have been removed, making construction\u0026ndash;particularly involving side-by-side RHW-4 portals\u0026ndash;far less temperamental. More details can be found in the Flexible Underpasses (FLUPs) Feature Guide. A conflict between the new FLUPs and the old, legacy RHW FLUPs Crossing Puzzle Pieces (particularly the RHW-2 and RHW-4 crossings) has been resolved. Note that any old RHW-2 and RHW-4 FLUPs Crossing Puzzle Pieces will need to be rebuilt. The Rails and Misc Transit menus have been revamped, to bring the base networks back up to the top of the menu. A pathing issue preventing traffic from utilizing the center tile on RHW-6C and RHW-8C crossings involving the Road and One-Way Road Draggable Viaducts has been resolved. The RHW Diagonal FLEXHeight Transitions (FLEX-HT) should now properly support L3-L4 MIS and L3-L4 RHW-4. A new FLEX Piece has been added to the Avenue intersections button, allowing two Streets to intersect an Avenue without crossing. Being FLEX-based, it also supports SAM Streets. The RHW Orthgonal Type E1 FLEXRamps and DRIs should no longer automatically produce RHW-3 out the top of the ramp\u0026rsquo;s mainline, improving overall stability with other networks. A glitch involving intersections following Dual Slip Lanes off the Type 110 FLEX Turn Lanes (FTLs) has been resolved. Fractional Angle Road intersections with the Street network now feature improved textures by Jiwoahn. Version 40 (1 April 2021) # The installation package has been refined to minimize the potential for Windows users failing to properly install the 4GB Patch and having the game crash to desktop (CTD) as a result\u0026ndash;the #1 tech support issue with recent NAM releases. A new batch file has been introduced to automate the process of applying the 4GB Patch to the game\u0026rsquo;s executable (special thanks to CorinaMarie), and installation options for \u0026ldquo;Low RAM/No RHW\u0026rdquo; versions of the NAM Controller have been added for users who on Windows XP and other 32-bit operating systems, and/or have less than 4GB RAM. (The Mac version, being 64-bit, does not require the 4GB Patch.) Windows users should begin the installation process with \u0026ldquo;NetworkAddonMod_Setup_Version40.bat\u0026rdquo; instead of the .jar file. Draggable Slip Lanes are now possible at Orthogonal x Diagonal (OxD) intersections involving base Streets, Roads, One-Way Roads, and Avenues. Simply drag the One-Way Road tool between the intersecting networks at the appropriate corner to make the connection. About 40 new ramp interfaces have been added to the RealHighway (RHW) system, including Diagonal Type A1 and B1 ramps for all ground networks, Diagonal Type D1 and E1 for the L0 RHW-2, RHW-3, RHW-4, RHW-6S, RHW-8S, RHW-8C, and RHW-10S, along with Orthogonal Type D1 and E1 ramps for the L0 RHW-3. Additionally, the D1 and E1 ramps have been rebased from RHW-4 to RHW-3, improving override stability in the process. The new Subway-based FLUPs system has been expanded to include entrance/exit portals for the RHW-3 and RHW-4 networks, along with underground ramp interfaces for all present networks. Additionally, some path jumping issues with certain NWM overrides of the FLEX Overcrossing Pieces (FLEX-OCPs) have been corrected. Small 90° Curve (2x2) support has been expanded. The Road Small 90° can now accept overrides from the Road-based Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks (TLA-3, AVE-2, ARD-3, and NRD-4), and One-Way Road Small 90° Curves are now supported as well, which allow overrides from the NWM\u0026rsquo;s OWR-1 and OWR-3. It is now possible to build Diverters for Road, Street, and (same type) SAM +-intersections, allowing one to divert thru traffic and convert the intersections into pairs of Small 90° Wide Radius Curves, while still allowing Pedestrian usage. For instructions on the build process, please consult the Base Features Guide in the main documentation package. All of the override networks included in the Network Widening Mod (NWM) can now form Orthogonal x Orthogonal (OxO) + and T-intersections with Street Addon Mod (SAM) Sets 2 through 11. The Auto-Destruct Hole Diggers and Raisers have been expanded to include smaller increments\u0026ndash;0.1 meters, 0.5 meters, 1 meter, 2 meters, and 5 meters. The Orthogonal RHW FLEX On-Slope Transitions (FLEX-OSTs) have undergone further refinement. The Diagonal RHW FLEX Height Transitions (FLEX-HTs) now support overrides for higher elevations of the RHW-4 and MIS Ramp networks (L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4). The Network Widening Mod (NWM) is once again referred to by its original name in the installer, rather than as \u0026ldquo;Additional Widths and Turn Lanes\u0026rdquo;. The newer overrideable versions of the Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) for Road now have proper Euro textures. The stability of the OWR-1 override of the RIRO/LILO (Right/Left In, Right/Left Out) Slip Lanes has been improved. Stability improvements have been made to the Type 220 x Type 220 T-Intersection in the FLEX Turn Lane/QuickTurn system. Issues with the Single-Tile Roundabouts allowing the network to drag out the incorrect side (and not out the correct side) in Left-Hand Driving (LHD) mode have been addressed. and T-intersections involving One-Way Road-based \u0026ldquo;Boulevards\u0026rdquo; (a configuration in which two One-Way Roads are separated by a one-tile median) no longer inadvertently convert into One-Way Road Roundabouts. Minor file architecture improvements have been made to prevent installation errors involving the Legacy Auto Avenue Turn Lanes and Legacy Semi-Auto Road Turning Lanes, which would lead to blank intersections and approaches at Avenue x Avenue and Road x Road intersections\u0026ndash;the #2 tech support issue in recent NAM releases. A long-standing missing texture glitch with the L1-L4 RHW-4 Type E1 ramps has been corrected. An adjacency glitch involving the RHW-2 connection to the One-Way Road Roundabouts when next to a Diagonal Road connection has been addressed. Various other minor stability improvements have been made to the RHW, NWM, and HRW (Hybrid Railway) RUL2 override code. Version 39 (3 December 2020) # New Subway-based draggable implementation of the Flexible Underpass (FLUPs) system added, with FLEX-based network portals (modeled by Girafe) and underground networks for the RealHighway\u0026rsquo;s RHW-2 and MIS networks. These portals include working nightlights, and options for both Maxis Nite and Dark Nite (selectable under the \u0026ldquo;Texture and Drive Side Support\u0026rdquo; section of the installer). Three new draggable \u0026ldquo;Alternate Viaduct\u0026rdquo; styles added for the Road Viaducts\u0026ndash;Stone Arch, Steel Arch, and Japanese (JPN) Facelift. These new viaducts act as separate networks, and are designed specifically for use as part of short oorthogonal overpasses over orthogonal networks, starting from On-Slope Transitions. Additionally, the Alternate Viaducts can be overridden by the Street network and some SAM types. A FLEX On-Slope transition (FLEX-OST) has been added for the Hybrid Railway (HRW) FLEX-based dual-network. FLEX On-Slope Transitions (FLEX-OSTs) for the RealHighway (RHW) plugin have been fixed, and now function as intended. Support for 90° R1 \u0026ldquo;Mini-Curves\u0026rdquo; (3x3 footprint) has been added for the Road network. Diagonal crossover paths and DIPs (Distilled Intersection Paths) have been added to the diagonals for the Wider RHW networks (courtesy of McDuell and Triple-Tile NWM networks (courtesy of Ganaram Inukshuk), improving capacity and functionality of the diagonal RHW-8S, RHW-10S, RHW-6C, RHW-8C, TLA-7, and AVE-6 networks. Various improvements have been made to the NWM TLA-7/AVE-6-to-Dual-OWR-3 draggable transition, including the addition of proper Distilled Intersection Paths (DIPs) to mitigate capacity issues, along with fixing broken LHD pathing The RULs for the LHD version of the FLEX Turn Lanes (FTL) Type 130 x Type 110 intersections have been improved, to eliminate previous texture and path flipping errors. Version 38 (3 September 2020) # The L1 (Level 1, 7.5m height) Draggable Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue Viaducts can now form diagonal crossings with the following networks: Street, Road, One-Way Road, Avenue, Rail, Single-Track Rail (STR), Ground Light Rail (GLR), Elevated Light Rail, Monorail, L0 RHW-2, L0 RHW-3, L0 MIS, L0 RHW-4, L0 RHW-6S, L0 RHW-8S, L0 RHW-10S, L0 RHW-6C, L0 RHW-8C, and L1 MIS. Adjacency stability has been dramatically improved for all L1 Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue Viaduct crossings, and Diagonal FLEX Height Transitions have been added. Diagonal FLEX Height Transitions (FLEX-HT) for the RHW-2, MIS, and RHW-4 have been added (all L0-L1 only). Note that the RHW-2 version does not automatically produce L1 RHW-2 by dragging out the top\u0026ndash;a change that has been extended to the Orthogonal FLEX-HT as well, to improve stability. The Hybrid Rail (HR) FLEX Piece system has been added. Hybrid Rail tracks allow both Passenger Rail and Monorail/High Speed Rail traffic (designed for use with the future Real High Speed Rail (RHSR)), and also feature overhead catenaries. Stations, switches, and a base set of L1 Viaducts have been included. Transitions between different Street sets in the Street Addon Mod (SAM) plugin are now possible, thanks to the addition of a new FLEX Transition piece. New Single-Tile Roundabout FLEX Piece added. The Single-Tile Roundabout allows for connections to Road and Street, and as the name indicates, takes up less room than the NAM\u0026rsquo;s other Roundabout options. The Road Roundabouts have become more flexible, allowing double corner connections. Stability and pathng improvements have also been made. The diagonals for the Wider RHWs have received stability coding improvements. In addition, a capacity issue with the RHW-6C and RHW-8C diagonals has been addressed. The RHW Disconnector now covers all possible network combinations (including Non-RHW Combinations), allowing for more gentle bulldozing of any network setting. A multitude of pathing issues have been addressed, including a number of paths dating back to the original game, which had somehow escaped both Maxis and the NAM Team for the past 16 years. Some of the overridable Road Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) added in NAM 37 have been migrated to new Instance IDs (IIDs) and may need to be rebuilt. This change is designed to better accomodate future expansion of One-Way Road Multi-Radius Curve and Fractional Angle capabilities. The GLR/Tram-in-Road and GLR/Tram-on-Street stations have been restored. Version 37 (2 July 2020) # The NAM has switched over to a new Java-based installer designed by daeley, with cross-platform support for any operating system that supports the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The RealHighway (RHW) system has undergone a massive code overhaul (\u0026ldquo;Mark IV\u0026rdquo;), greatly improving stability, especially in compact situations. Diagonal x Diagonal (DxD) crossings (grade-separated) between wider RHW networks should now be possible in most situations. The RealRailway (RRW) system is now the default (and only) option for the Rail network. Users wishing to retain the original Maxis Rail should download the separate Maxis Rail Legacy Plugin. Various cosmetic/legacy plugins, such as the Bullet Train Mod (BTM) and El-Rail Alternate Implementation, are no longer directly available within the main NAM download, due to crosslink and support issues. They will be available as separate downloads, as Legacy Plugins with no guarantee of support or further upgrades. An initial basic version of the RealExpressway (REW) mod is now available. A pathing issue affecting intersections with the Diagonal Streets Plugin, dating back to NAM 20 (!) has now been fixed (thanks to McDuell). RRW Fractional Angle and FlexTrack switch content can now be constructed using easier-to-use FLEX Pieces, rather than memorizing drag/draw patterns. Some limited Fractional Angle elevated support is now available. The Road-based Single-Tile and Dual-Tile Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks now support Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs). For the single-tile networks, override the base Road MRCs with the appropriate NWM network to convert them, and use the dedicated pieces for the dual-tile versions (the RD-6 uses an override of the TLA-5 version\u0026ndash;place Road stubs to fill in the \u0026ldquo;bites\u0026rdquo; on the RD-6 R4 curve). L3 and L4 FLEXFly pieces are now available for the RHW. RHW FlexSPUI has been redesigned, with improved support for the current array of RHW networks. Support for L0 and L2 is present (use the legacy TuLEP OnSlope to connect to the L2 version). Orthogonal TLA-3 and AVE-2 connections to the One-Way Road Roundabouts are now supported. Three new RHW FLEXRamps are now supported: Type D1-Inside (RHW-4 base), Type E1-Inside (RHW-4 base), and Type D1-Inside Dual Shift (RHW-6C base). Additionally, L1 and L2 support has been added to the Type A2 ramps for the RHW-8C and RHW-10S networks, and the L1 and L2 versions of the RHW-3 network now support Type A1 and B1 ramps. Various \u0026ldquo;tidal flow\u0026rdquo;-related pathing issues with the Draggable Elevated One-Way Road Viaducts have been addressed. File encoding issues with certain NAM files that have been known to cause crash-to-desktop (CTD) errors with Aspyr\u0026rsquo;s new 64-bit macOS port of SimCity 4 (currently just the App Store version) have been fixed. A new bridge has been added for the NWM\u0026rsquo;s NRD-4 network. Changes introduced since the NAM 37 Release Candidate of 23/24 April 2020: # The new FlexSPUI V2 now works properly in LHD mode. Drag pattern interference between the new draggable Road Small 90° Curve and the Road Long FA3 (71.6°) curve has been eliminated. Issues with various RHW and NWM bridges have been addressed, including the RHW-4 Small Steel Arch, the RHW-6S Concrete Arch Dual, and the NRD-4 Thru Truss. The accidentally-omitted DDRHW-4 bridge has also (again) be re-added. Missing textures/paths on some RHW T-intersections involving diagonals have been addressed. New draggable Road curves (Small 90° and Small S) have received Euro texture support. Issues involving the L1 RHW-8C crossings over Avenue have been addressed. Pathing for the RHW-3-to-ARD-3 transition has been fixed. The texture for the OWR-3 x OWR-2 +-intersection has been rotated to the correct direction. Tidal flow issues with the Slip Lane functionality, causing paths to not function in certain directions (esp. in LHD) have been fixed. Various Euro texture issues with the RHW-8C Type D1 ramp have been fixed. The OWR-1-to-MIS transition has been fixed. Avenue-to-MIS transitions have been fixed. Both US and EU textures for the RHW-6C and 8C Type D1 Dual Shift Inside FLEXRamp have been fixed. Various fixes have been made to the RealRailway (RRW) network. Pathing fixes have been made to the draggable Wide-Radius Curve (WRC)/Multi-Radius Curve (MRC) and Fractional Angle (FA) functionality. TLA Center Turn Arrow cosmetic mod now installed as option under Texture and Drive Side options, fixing previous file architecture issues. Mac-only issues with GHSR network showing Monorail supports have been fixed. Some INRUL-based issues with the RRW FlexTrack system have been addressed, particularly with the J2 Turnout (Ortho-to-FARR-1.33/1.5). Note that these changes have altered the availability of some drag patterns, and clicking on some existing switches may break them. Such switches will need to be rebuilt using their FLEX Piece equivalent. Note that no new features have been added since the NAM 37 Release Candidate. Addition of new content will resume with NAM 38 development. Monolithic Releases (2013 through 2017) # Version 36 (13 September 2017) # New FLEX Turn Lanes (FTL) feature added, providing a more intuitive and flexible alternative to the old Turn Lane Extension Pieces (TuLEPs, now deprecated). Draggable Elevated RealRailway (RRW) viaducts added at L1 (7.5 meter) and L2 (15 meter) heights. One-Way Road Signalized Intersection and Turn Arrow Project (SITAP) expanded to cover intersections with FLEX Turn Lanes and Road-based multi-tile NWM networks. Street Addon Mod (SAM) Set 11 - IndustrieSAM by mgb204 added, providing a new, industrial-style Street texture. Draggable Wide-Radius Curve functionality added to all applicable Street Addon Mod (SAM) override networks. RealRailway (RRW) FlexTrack functionality expanded to cover additional setups. R5 radius Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) added to the Road network. Diagonal FLEX On-Slope Transitions added to the RHW, supporting 1 and 2-level transitions for the RHW-2, RHW-4, and MIS networks. R4 and R5 radii Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) added to the RealHighway (RHW) system, with support for the L0 RHW-2, L0 RHW-4, and L0 RHW-6S netwoks. Overlap ability also added to the ground-level R2 curves for the RHW, allowing for smoother loop ramps. Diagonal MIS Connection support added to the One-Way Road Roundabouts. Texture glitch fixed with the Euro version of the L1-L4 RHW-6S Type A2 FLEXRamps/DRIs. Minor pathing fix to improve zone access on the TLA-7 network in the Network Widening Mod (NWM). The compression scheme on the NAM Installer has been changed, making it such that the external 7-Zip SFX layer surrounding it is no longer needed. New edition of the NAM documentation started, marking a return to the HTML format used prior to the NAM 31.x releases of 2013. Please note that due to the incredible scope of the mod, and the amount of time to adequately document features, that some sections may remain in an incomplete state. Version 35 (4 November 2016) # New RealRailway (RRW) FlexTrack functionality, including draggable Fractional Angle Railroads (FARR) at three angles (FA-2, FA-3, and FA-1.33/1.5) and improved Single-Track Rail (STR) support. Vastly improved adjacency stability for ramp-style RealHighway (RHW) FLEX Height Transitions, including many adjacencies with FLEXRamps and Draggable Ramp Interfaces (DRIs). Several new draggable NWM transitions: NRD-4-to-ARD-3, NRD-4-to-Avenue, NRD-4-to-TLA-5, NRD-4-to-RD-4, Road-to-RD-4, TLA-3-to-Avenue, TLA-3-to-TLA-5, AVE-2-to-TLA-5, AVE-2-to-Avenue, TLA-7/AVE-6-to-Dual-OWR-3, OWR-4-to-RHW-8S, OWR-5-to-RHW-10S, and OWR-1-to-MIS. These transitions can either be built through the stub method, or (in case of different base networks), direct connection. At-grade intersection support for the Road, OWR, and Avenue Viaducts, plus other stability and cosmetic improvements. Multi-Radius Curve (MRC) functionality added to the L1 and L2 RHW-2. A number of path fixes involving elevated RHW networks. Support for at-grade RHW-4 x Avenue, RHW-3 x Avenue and MIS x Street intersections (OxO only), as well as improvements and additions to RHW-2 and MIS diagonal intersections with Maxis surface networks. Proper P57-era RHW support for Moonlinght\u0026rsquo;s Alternate El-Rail and Bullet Train (Shinkansen) mods (OxO only). Various fixes to the Maxis Highway Override (MHO), including improved RealRailway (RRW) support, support for moonlinght\u0026rsquo;s Alternate El-Rail and Bullet Train, and Level Bridges for both L0 and L2 MHO networks. Re-implementation of some multi-tile RHW and NWM starter pieces, to improve stability in preparation for future additions. Legacy code has been added to provide stability to older, unconverted starters. Version 34 (25 December 2015) # The Tram-in-Avenue (TiA), Tram-in-Road (TiR), Tram-on-Road (ToR), and Tram-on-Street (ToS) dual networks are now partially draggable. To activate the dual networks, click the Elevated Rail tool over Avenue for TiA, the Elevated Rail tool over Road for TiR, the Rail tool for ToR, and the Elevated Rail tool on Street for ToS. Elevated RealHighway (RHW) networks and draggable Elevated Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue Viaducts can now form overpasses over Tram-in-Avenue, Tram-in-Road, Tram-on-Road, and Tram-on-Street dual networks. Simply drag the crossing network up to the edge of the Tram Dual-Network to form a stub, and begin dragging from stub on the other side of the Tram Dual-Network to continue the network. Some support for networks besides RHWs and the Road Viaducts has also been added, using similar means. RealHighway crossings over Network Widening Mod networks are now vastly more stable. Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) for the Road network have been added in draggable form, in four different radii (R1-R4). Signalized intersections for One-Way Roads are now possible in the initial phase of the OWR Signalization and Turn Arrow Project (SITAP), complete with turn arrows before the intersection (NOTE: LHD functionality for this feature may still be limited). These signals cannot automatically appear, due to the game\u0026rsquo;s handling of One-Way Road mechanics, but can be activated by transitioning from One-Way Road to Road just before the intersection. For intersections between two One-Way Roads, it is necessary to click over the resultant 90-degree Road bend with the One-Way Road tool. +-intersections and T-intersections between One-Way Roads and Roads, One-Way Roads, Avenues, and +-intersections (no T-intersections) with single-tile Road-based NWM networks (TLA-3, AVE-2, ARD-3, NRD-4) are available. 7 new bridges by eggman121 have been added, including the first-ever NWM bridges for the RD-4 and RD-6 networks, plus a new RHW-4 bridge, and four RealRailway (RRW) bridges. FLEX On-Slope Transitions for the Elevated Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue Viaducts have been improved to support tighter situations, where a network is directly below the elevated end of the transition. Many Elevated RHW base network features now show preview textures. An issue with High Speed Rail crossings over wider ground-level RHW networks has been addressed. An issue preventing the proper override of the ramp interfaces on L1 RHW QuickChanges has been fixed. Some clickaround may still be necessary to force the overrides to continue. Version 33 (26 November 2015) # Massive update to the Draggable Ramp Interface (DRI) and FLEXRamp systems in the RealHighway (RHW) Mod. 90% of all previous static puzzle piece ramps have been given easier-to-use FLEX and/or draggable counterparts, and a plethora of new ramp interfaces for elevated RHW networks are now available, Wealth textures are included for ground level versions. The RHW FLEXFly system has been completely overhauled, and now includes 90-degree and 45-degree versions, in single and dual-lane configurations, at Ground Level (L0), 7.5m (L1), and 15m (L2) heights. The double-decker RHW-4 (DDRHW-4) has been lowered one level (from L2/L3 to L1/L2), increasing ease of use. The DDRHW-4 has also gained support for DRIs and FLEXRamps, including A1 and B1 Outside and Inside Ramps. Disconnector added, to simplify demolition of FLEX-based RHW pieces. Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs), in both draggable and FLEX form, have been added to the RealHighway Mod, in three different radii, for the RHW-2, MIS, RHW-4, and RHW-6S. Stability improvements to the FLEX Height Transitions. Major improvements to the RealRailway (RRW) plugin, which now supports most crossings. Transit station functionality and compatibility has been further improved. Minor fixes to other NAM components. New High Speed Rail Project (HSRP) textures, courtesy of vershner. Changes introduced since the NAM 33 Pre-Release of 29 July 2015: # The RealRailway (RRW) FlexTrack system makes an earlier-than-expected debut. See the FlexTrack User\u0026rsquo;s Guide in the Documentation folder for more details. PedMall functionality greatly enhanced with the addition of access paths to most non-Highway-type road networks, including NWM networks and Tram/El-Rail Dual-Networking items. Pedestrians may now directly access the PedMalls from these other networks without the need of a station or other transit-enabled lot/switch. Many custom bridges that previously blocked all ferry traffic have now been corrected. MandelSoft\u0026rsquo;s previous RHW texture sets, including Euro, Ontario, and Irish/South African textures, have been discontinued. A new standard Euro RHW set, based on the default US set, has been added as a replacement, and adds compatibility for all current RHW features. An issue with the NAM 33 Pre-Release in which the Controller Compiler would fail due to an XML read error has been fixed. Several overhanging texture issues with the new RHW ramp interfaces have been corrected. The R3 FLEX-Multi Radius Curve now rotates fully as intended. A number of Left-Hand Drive transit path file issues across the entire mod have been added or corrected for proper functionality. Version 32.1 [Mac-only] (28 June 2014) # Solved file encoding issues on Additional Bridges, High Monorail, and High Elevated Rail, which prevented the NAM from running on Universal Binary versions of the Aspyr Mac port of SimCity 4 Deluxe. Introduced an installer to NAM Mac version, using a Wineskin wrapper of the Windows installer. Addressed some other transportation-related issues present in the Aspyr Mac port. Version 32 (14 January 2014) # The NAM Elevated Viaducts for Roads, One-Way Roads, and Avenues are now available in a draggable form, at both Level 1 (7.5 meter) and Level 2 (15 meter) heights, complete with FLEX Height and On-Slope transitions. Overpass situations involving one or more diagonal networks are not yet supported. Elevated Rail-over-Avenue and Elevated Rail-over-NWM Road-4 dual-networking support has been added, complete with a new station supporting both networks. The initial phases of the RealRailway (RRW) system have been added. This feature must be selected as part of a custom install. The RealHighway (RHW) system has been expanded to include the QuickChange interchange system, which blends the RHW\u0026rsquo;s modularity with the ease of Maxis Highway construction techniques for certain situations, which will be expanded in future NAM releases. Additionally, several new types of FLEXRamps are available\u0026ndash;please read the instructions in the description text. FLEX Transitions have also been given stability improvements for certain situations. Coupled with the RHW system, the NAM now offers Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) functionality, including stations. Transit station functionality has been further improved, including the beginning of the implementation of the SLURP, which will gradually raise all transit stations to NAM standards. The NAM Controller Compiler has been included with the installer, with which it now communicates, ensuring that only the installed features are incorporated into the NAM Controller, reducing file size and load times. (The e-series and s-series controllers have been discontinued.) About 50 bugs reported since the start of the NAM 32 Pre-Release have also been squished, including some that had been present since earlier versions of the NAM. It is highly recommended that users update to the latest NAM in order to enjoy a more stable experience. Version 31.2 (4 June 2013) # Integration of 4GB Patch into installer, further preventing risk of CTDs on newer systems. Maxis Highway Custom Interchanges button re-enabled, after fixing HID re-index issue in RUL0 file. \u0026ldquo;Sinkhole-to-China\u0026rdquo; bugs fixed on several RealHighway (RHW) pieces. L2 RHW x RHW OxD Stability improved. Maxis Highway Override/\u0026ldquo;Project Symphony\u0026rdquo; Type A ramp is now able to be fully rotated. RHW-10S bridge no longer has issues with missing tiles. DDRHW-4 paths now at proper heights. Maxis Highway Override/\u0026ldquo;Project Symphony\u0026rdquo; no longer causes CTDs when dragged under High Speed Rail. Further improvements to RealHighway filler pieces. Maxis Highway Override/\u0026ldquo;Project Symphony\u0026rdquo; OxD crossing with Rail Viaducts now facing the correct direction on all tiles. Multiple \u0026ldquo;rainbow tile\u0026rdquo; issues fixed. Some files moved from Rail Viaducts to Base Contents, to address issue with \u0026ldquo;missing tiles\u0026rdquo; reported by users who did not install the viaducts. Several LHD path fixes for bridges. Under/overpass on starter situations improved for RHW starters. While the expanded RealHighway functionality available in the 31.x-series releases is much more stable in Version 31.2, issues still exist with the L1 and L2 Diagonal RHW-6C, 8C, 8S, and 10S, when crossing over other RealHighways. The overpass may behave as if it is prevented, or produce inexplicable results. Due to the complexity of the coding for any sort of crosslinking between two override networks (especially when one is multi-tile and diagonal), solving this issue is a veritable \u0026ldquo;needle in the haystack\u0026rdquo; situation, and will take substantial time to correct. Support will not be provided for issues involving these overpasses. Two multi-purpose transit stations by E-N of BriPizza have been added, serving the orthogonal intersections of almost all single-width networks that differ in height by 15m. The NAM Ideal Transit Switches (NITS) have been introduced. The NITS provide greatly increased efficiency for all combo NAM transit stations (e.g., all stations with subway access and at least one other major network), which results in greater network usage. Controller updated to version r184. Please note that the installer will \u0026ldquo;seek and destroy\u0026rdquo; old NAM installations in your Plugins, so there is no need to worry about uninstalling/deleting your old NAM. Version 31.1 (6 April 2013) # Controller divided into two different packages to improve stability\u0026ndash;the smaller \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;s-series\u0026rdquo;) package, and the larger \u0026ldquo;extreme\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;e-series\u0026rdquo;), to improve stability issues present with NAM 31. Road Turning Lanes \u0026ldquo;semi-automatic\u0026rdquo; functionality has changed implementation, from Rail overclick to One-Way Road overclick. A number of transit stations have had bugs fixed or performance otherwise enhanced, and several optional new stations have been added. For PC users, any stations plopped in your cities from NAM 31 will automatically be upgraded when you install NAM 31.1.For Mac users, the replacement set of basic Maxis stations had to be modified, along with the Modern El Train Station by Brenda Xne. These fixes were necessary due to a bug in the Mac version of SC4. If you\u0026rsquo;re a Mac user and you plopped any of these stations from the NAM using version 31, you will have to bulldoze them and replop them once you have installed NAM 31.1. New Street network functionality: Some new draggable wide-radius curves, and intersections along wide-radius curves, are now possible with the Street network. Credit for this new feature goes to Swordmaster from the NAM Team. RealHighway Filler Pieces have been restored and expanded after previous issues. Installing over previous versions: NAM 31.1 may be installed directly over top of any previous NAM releases. It is a full release, not a patch or a hotfix. All future updates are planned to be in full package form, and there are no plans to issue patches or hotfixes in the future. Please also note that the NAM Team only provides technical support for the most recent version, which, as of this document, is NAM 31.1. We cannot assist users of the original NAM 31 release, or NAM 30 (or earlier). Special Thanks: The NAM Team would like to thank the following members of the community, who have tested the penultimate build of the NAM 31.1 controller and given their feedback on its stability, and/or assisted with other controller-related tests after the NAM 31 release, in an effort to nail down the game stability issues: A Nonny Moose, dyoungyn, Joe 90, mgarcia, mneonnew, shanghai kid, spot, and txrailcat74. Version 31.0 (2 March 2013) # The NAM has changed to a \u0026ldquo;monolithic\u0026rdquo; package. With the exception of the Diagonal Bridge Enabler (DBE), all other separate-download NAM plugins have been merged into the main package, including the RealHighway Mod (RHW), the Railway Addon Mod (RAM), the Network Widening Mod (NWM), the High Speed Rail Project (HSRP), the Street Addon Mod (SAM), and the Rural Roads Plugin (RuRP). All NAM-issued bridges have also been incorporated into the package. These plugins may all be selected as options in the new and improved NAM installer. Substantial expansion of the RealHighway (RHW) Mod network options, including the addition of the full Multi-Height System, which allows four elevated heights-L1 (7.5m), L2 (15m), L3 (22.5m), and L4 (30m). All widths of the RHW also now have L1 and L2 elevated counterparts, and the RHW-4, RHW-6S, and MIS Ramps have L3 and L4 available. The RHW also now includes FLEX Height Transitions (FLEX-HT), FLEX On-Slope Transitions (FLEX-OST), FLEX Ramp Interfaces (FLEXRamps), accommodating many of the new networks without adding massive numbers of new puzzle pieces. Draggable Fractional Angle Roads have been added at two different angles-FA3 (18.4°/71.6°) and a new angle, FA2 (26.6°/63.4°). For the first time ever, the NAM now includes Lots, adding a basic variety of stations for NAM override networks that require them, including Ground Light Rail, the Tram/El-Rail Dual Networks, and High Speed Rail. Starter Pieces have now been converted to include a self-destructing construction lot, simplifying construction. Hole Diggers and Raisers have also been added in two forms: the conventional Lot-based approach, and a new self-destructing variant. Maxis Highway Override, AKA Project Symphony, has been added. This plugin converts the Maxis Highways from 6 undersized lanes, to 4 RHW-scaled lanes, and better allows the network to interface with RHW functionality. Wide Radius Curves added to the Monorail network. Moonlinght\u0026rsquo;s popular Alternate El-Rail Mod and Bullet Train (Shinkansen) Mod have been added as optional skins for the El-Rail and Monorail networks, respectively. Two new SAM sets have been added: the Klinker Streets by squidi, and moonlinght\u0026rsquo;s Japanese Streets. \u0026ldquo;Modular\u0026rdquo; Releases (2007 through 2011) # Version 30 (15 September 2011) # Elevated Road, One-Way Road and Avenue viaduct models have been revamped, with new orthogonal-to-diagonal curves added to One-Way Road and Avenue Viaduct sets.

Two new styles of Draggable Ground Light Rail/Tram with easily-customizable base textures have been added with the Draggable GLR/Tram Extension Plugin. (Please note that due to the model-based nature of this functionality, the natively-built pillars on the Elevated Rail network had to be removed. You may need to reconstruct sections of your Elevated Rail network to re-add the pillars with this plugin installed.) RUL updates for the RealHighway Mod (RHW), Network Widening Mod (NWM), Street Addon Mod (SAM) and Diagonal Bridge Enabler (DBE), all downloaded separately. Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT) updated to Version 1.2.6, reflecting proper One-Way Road capacities. Version 29 (14 August 2010) # New Underground Rail puzzle pieces have been added.

Version 21 (1 June 2007) # The main NAM file has been divided into five resource files that can be updated individually. The RUL and INI files have been separated as \u0026ldquo;NAM Controller\u0026rdquo; for easier updates as well. GLR and dual-networking puzzle pieces have been made optional. Please note: If you are using the GLR or dual-networking puzzle pieces, make sure to select them in the optional components dialogue of the NAM installer. The same counts for other optional plugins, such as the roundabouts or turning lanes. Additional plugins, such as bridges or the RHW mod, are released as individual plugins. Please note: If you are using additional bridges that use custom bridge models in your cities, you will have to install them separately. They are no longer contained in the main NAM download. The LTEXT labels have been separated from the NAM DATs in order to make translations easier. In addition to the GLR puzzle pieces, draggable GLR is now available, using dedicated starter puzzle pieces (both urban and rural versions). GLR-in-Avenue puzzle pieces have been added, as well as GLR-on-slope puzzle pieces. The appearance of the GLR tracks has been changed to a more urban look. The old textures for the puzzle pieces are still available as an optional plugin. Similar textures for the draggable GLR might be released in the future. Avenue Roundabouts have been added, available under a new menu button that also contains the other avenue intersections, such as the Avenue Y-Stack. Highway-on-slope puzzle pieces has been added. Elevated (heavy) Rail and Underground Rail puzzle pieces now have more options, such as 45° turns and diagonals. Smooth Road Curve and S-Curve puzzle pieces have been added. A plugin that removes most of the OneWayRoad arrows has been added. Some menu icons have been graphically improved. The number of files contained in all NAM DATs reaches 19,000. The NAM core files are not longer considered as a \u0026ldquo;beta\u0026rdquo; version. However, certain plugins might still be in beta status. A BSC Cleanitol file has been created that helps removing outdated NAM files and related transit mods. Early Releases (2004 through 2007) # Version 20 (26 December 2006) # Diagonal Streets plugin has been enhanced. There are now some additional puzzle pieces to be used on sloped terrains to avoid flattening. Furthermore, there are a few helper pieces which allow you to drag other networks over it to build intersections. All the game effects on the ped mall puzzle pieces have been removed again because ped malls had acted like a cheat. The generation of crowds has also been removed because it forced older computers to be very slow. Many cosmetic issues have been done. Some raised puzzle pieces have been remodelled, and the one-way bridges come with one-way textures now. A set of puzzle pieces to build commute rail tunnels has been added. You may use the default Maxis railway station to handle the traffic switching or (may be) any upcoming underground commute rail station. Long Turn Rail puzzle piece has been added. European-style lateral highway exits and another one for raised roads have been added. The custom bridges MOD became part of the NAM. You may choose different new styles of bridges for the common networks. NAM readme updated to a more convenient layout. Some screenshots illustrate the usage of puzzle pieces and roundabouts. Version 19 (30 September 2005) # NAM now has an Installer which can guide users through the installation. Format of NAM versions changed from MMDDYY to YYMMDD. The Structure of the NAM Folders \u0026amp; Documentation has been modified. This has been done due to an Installer now being available. Missing Rail Y-Stack added. Yes, it is actually added this time (those of you with the temporary fix for this, be sure to remove it). Diagonal Start/End Road \u0026amp; OneWayRoad PuzzlePiece items adjusted to reduce possible terrain indentation when being placed. Graphical improvements made to GLR on PedMallTile items. Various ElevatedRail on Street Dual-Networking PuzzlePieces added. See the Contents for more details. GLR Loop PuzzlePiece item added. Rail double Width\\Tile Orthogonal S-Curve added. Rail (Double) Diagonal x Orthogonal Unlimited. This supersedes the previous Double Diagonal x (single) Orthogonal Rail junction. Avenue Intersections\\Junctions: several new avenue intersections \u0026amp;/or junction types have now been added \u0026amp;/or are now possible. See the Contents for more details. OneWayRoad Roundabouts have now been added \u0026amp; currently exist as an additional optional plugin. The existing OneWayRoad network tool is used for this. Street Roundabouts have now been added \u0026amp; currently exists as an additional optional plugin. The existing Street network tool is used for this. Adjustments implemented for Avenue curve x Road/Street/OneWayRoad to address graphical issues. Adjustments made to several PedMallTile items due to graphical conflicts. Shadows fixed on ElevatedHighway Curve \u0026amp; several ElevatedHighway Curve x Street/Road/Rail/OneWayRoad/Avenue junctions. A list of Additional Intersections \u0026amp; Junctions (for normal networks) has now been included \u0026amp; can be found in the Contents. YIMBY Effects on Ped Mall Tiles \u0026amp; Footbridges adjusted to more balanced levels \u0026amp; are as follows: Type of Effect (Magnitude, Radius) Landmark Effect (70,7) Park Effect (35,7) Mayor Rating Effect (5,8) Air Pollution Reduction (-5,3) Water Pollution Reduction (0,0) Garbage Reduction (1,0) Version 18 (25 July 2005) # Due to a recent file format discovery a number of intersections\u0026rsquo; files have been adjusted to address current \u0026amp; possible future issues. Due to these adjustments, any existing items that made use of these adjusted items will be affected \u0026amp; may show as an invisible tile in-game. If this occurs, please bulldoze \u0026amp; rebuild the given intersection \u0026amp;/or section of network to correct the problem. The Structure of the NAM Folders \u0026amp; Installation Files has been modified. This has been done to better handle some of the additional plugins that this mod contains. Please see the Installation Instructions regarding installation. Diagonal Streets have now been added \u0026amp; currently exist as an additional optional plugin. The existing Street Network tool is used for this. Please note: This does not change the inherent functionality of the Street Tool. To trigger diagonal streets, simply zig-zag the street tool \u0026amp; the tiles will automatically change \u0026amp; update. Please note: As at the time of writing this particular item was currently in Beta still. Roundabouts have now been added \u0026amp; currently exist as an additional optional plugin. The existing Network Tools, where applicable, are used for this. To trigger roundabouts, simply join road in a four tile area like a circle. Many variations exist with the Road, OneWayRoad \u0026amp; Street networks. If in doubt, please experiment. Please note: As at the time of writing this particular item was currently in Beta still. Rail Y-Stack added. This is currently located in the Rail PuzzlePieces menu button. This is similar to the AvenueY-stack. Avenue \u0026amp; OneWayRoad Onslope PuzzlePieces added \u0026amp; can be found in their appropriate PuzzlePiece menu button. Over 50+ new intersections, junction \u0026amp;/or network possibility types added. These are many \u0026amp; varied but encompass most of the above ground networks. If in doubt, please experiment. Several new path, drawing \u0026amp;/or graphical bug fixes added. These fixes relate to original Maxis items \u0026amp; also custom content items. Please note: It may require rebuilding some sections of network \u0026amp;/or also the game given several game months, if not a lot longer (i.e. 2 years depending on city size, pc specs etc), in order for some of these fixes to take affect. Most internal files have now been compressed to help reduce the overall file size of the NAM. This should not affect functionality. Main NAM.dat surpasses 10,000 files mark. Version 17 (17 June 2005) # Main mod file by default, no longer contains Avenue Tuning Lanes (ATL). This portion of the mod exists as an optional component by way of an additional Plugin file. Please see the Installation Instructions regarding this optional plugin file. Numerous visual improvements made to various existing items. 70 plus new junctions \u0026amp;/or intersection types added. These new junctions typically involve \u0026ldquo;Network1 Piece or JunctionType, Network2 Overhead (or underneath ~ relative to Network1)\u0026rdquo;. As some examples; Orthogonal Street + Junction, Diagonal ElevatedRail. Also; Orthogonal Rail + Junction, Diagonal ElevatedHighway. And; Orthogonal ElevatedRail + Junction, Diagonal Avenue. And many others similar to these involving all the different (above ground) networks. If in doubt, please experiment. Version 16 (8 June 2005) # Ground Light Rail (GLR) Mod (Alpha 3) has been merged \u0026amp; included with the NAM. Currently at this time this inclusion only extends to Puzzle Piece related items. Please see the Contents for more details. Avenue Turning Lane (ATL) Mod (beta_04) has been merged \u0026amp; included with the NAM. Left-Hand Version players please see Installation Instructions for additional Plugin(s) required. Left Hand Version Rail-Networks Fix: A fix has been made, for players who actively use Left Hand Version of the game, for all of the Rail-Based networks. This fix encompasses Rail, ElevatedRail, MonoRail, \u0026amp; Subway networks \u0026amp; any intersections involving these networks. This fix makes adjustments so that the Trains on these networks operate \u0026amp; run on their proper side for Left-Hand Version players, just like cars do on road based networks. This fix is also UDI compliant (where applicable). This fix is only applicable \u0026amp; only intended for active Left-Hand Version players. This fix subsequently has a bearing on Transit Enabled Lots. Left-Hand Version players please see the Installation Instructions for additional Plugin(s) required. For more details regarding this fix please read the Technical Notes. Numerous visual improvements made to various existing items ~ of which there is to many to list. OneWayRoad Bridges have been adjusted. The models \u0026amp; textures they use are no longer dependent on the games own files, \u0026amp; hence can be changed. Please see the Contents for more details. Monorail over Elevated Highway overpass. Double Diagonal Rail x Orthogonal Avenue (this is a normal ground intersection). Numerous new Puzzle Pieces added. Any new Puzzle Pieces have been placed in their appropriate menu button. A majority of new Puzzle Piece items have been integrated into their existing appropriate Puzzle Pieces menu position \u0026amp; can be accessed via the Home/End keyboard key. For example; the Diagonal Road Start/End Puzzle Piece is integrated along with the existing Orthogonal Road Start/End Puzzle Piece. Using the Home/End keyboard keys will rotate the item from orthogonal to diagonal to orthogonal etc. The same applies to many other Puzzle Pieces containing a Diagonal component. Please see the Contents for more details. OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces have been overhauled to address Pathing/Automata issues that currently exist with them. Most OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces now contain Directional Enforcing \u0026amp; contain Directional Arrows to assist with their placement \u0026amp; general use. Please note: For this reason any existing OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces should be checked, preferably bulldozed \u0026amp; replaced, especially if Pathing issues start to arise. The game should also be given some time to adjust \u0026amp; update because of this. This adjustment will ultimately reduce the Pathing/Automata issues that currently exist with this item \u0026amp; make them function more efficiently. Using either query tools \u0026amp;/or the bulldozing tool \u0026amp; highlighting OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces (one tile at a time only) will show these Directional Arrows, \u0026amp; hence the flow of direction. The above paragraph subsequently also applies to OneWayRoad Overpasses. The existing 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Piece has been overhauled to address pathing/automata issue that currently exist with the item \u0026amp; now contain Directional Enforcing. Please note: For this reason any existing 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Pieces should be checked, preferably bulldozed \u0026amp; replaced, especially if Pathing issues start to arise. The game should also be given some time to adjust \u0026amp; update because of this. This adjustment will ultimately reduce the Pathing/Automata issues that currently exist with this item. Directional Arrows have now also been added to applicable 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Pieces \u0026amp; preview models to assist with their placement \u0026amp; general use. Using either query tools \u0026amp;/or the bulldozing tool \u0026amp; highlighting applicable 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Pieces (one tile at a time only) will show these Directional Arrows, \u0026amp; hence the flow of direction. Various other file item adjustments, improvements \u0026amp;/or fixes ~ of which there is to many to list. Main NAM.dat surpasses 8,000 files. Version 15 (8 March 2005) # Orthogonal Elevated Highway over Orthogonal Ground Highway Stack. Note; if you\u0026rsquo;ve used a previous (file) version of this in-game, for best usage be sure to bulldoze the item \u0026amp; re-build it. Diagonal Avenue transition into Orthogonal Road. To join, simply drag a straight road into a dead-end diagonal avenue. Orthogonal Road transition into Double Diagonal OneWayRoad – this must be joined using the Road tool, in a similar fashion as the Diagonal Avenue to Orthogonal Road transition above. Be sure when/if connecting this, that the Double Diagonal OneWayRoads\u0026rsquo; flow of traffic matches up with the road it\u0026rsquo;s transitioning into. Elevated Highway transition into Double OneWayRoad – Orthogonal \u0026amp; Diagonal. The Elevated Highway tool must be used to join the two networks, in the same fashion as ElevatedHighway\u0026lt;\u0026gt;Avenue transition; in order to join, the OneWayRoad section of network must be two tiles width. Fixed a pathing issue with games original Diagonal Elevated Highway over Orthogonal Elevated Highway overpass, which prevented vehicles from using the whole of one side of the diagonal highway overpass. New Orthogonal Elevated Highway (Raised) over Diagonal Elevated Highway (Flat) Overpass. The Orthogonal portion of the Elevated Highway rises over the Diagonal portion of the Elevated Highway. This is in addition to the games original overpass of this type, which has the Diagonal portion rising over the Orthogonal portion. If the conditions are right, this will be built automatically when using the Elevated Highway Tool. New Orthogonal Ground Highway (Raised) over Diagonal Ground Highway (Flat) Overpass. The Orthogonal portion of the Ground Highway rises over the Diagonal portion of the Ground Highway. This is in addition to the games original overpass of this type, which has the Diagonal portion rising over the Orthogonal portion. If the conditions are right, this will be built automatically when using the Ground Highway Tool. Minor fix of issues resulting from custom content (seems some particular custom related Overpasses have been unable to draw/build – this should now be fixed though). Double Diagonal Rail Merge, as well as new intersections related to this. It should now also be easier to draw/drag Double Diagonal Rail. Please note; that while numerous bugs related to this have been addressed, some may still exist. (Single) Orthogonal Rail x Double Diagonal Rail intersection, as well as new intersections related to this. Please note; that while numerous bugs related to the implementation of this have been addressed, some may still exist. A number of (other) Rail related (drawing) bugs \u0026amp;/or intersections addressed. Please note; that it may require bulldozing \u0026amp;/or (re-)drawing some sections/intersections of rail network in order for some of these addressed bugs to take effect. All existing Road/OneWayRoad/Avenue Overpasses, Puzzle Pieces, Ground \u0026amp; Elevated Highway Ramps Preview Models have been given a facelift. Following (diagonal-based) Puzzle Pieces added: Orthogonal Road over diagonal/double diagonal Rail Orthogonal Road over diagonal/double diagonal Road Orthogonal Road over diagonal/double diagonal OneWayRoad Orthogonal Road over diagonal Avenue Orthogonal Road over diagonal GroundHighway Orthogonal OneWayRoad over diagonal/double diagonal Rail Orthogonal OneWayRoad over diagonal/double diagonal Road Orthogonal OneWayRoad over diagonal/double diagonal OneWayRoad Orthogonal OneWayRoad over diagonal Avenue Orthogonal OneWayRoad over diagonal GroundHighway Orthogonal Avenue over diagonal/double diagonal Rail Orthogonal Avenue over diagonal/double diagonal Road Orthogonal Avenue over diagonal/double diagonal OneWayRoad Orthogonal Avenue over diagonal Avenue Orthogonal Avenue over diagonal GroundHighway Orthogonal Rail over diagonal/double diagonal Rail Orthogonal Rail over diagonal/double diagonal Road Orthogonal Rail over diagonal/double diagonal OneWayRoad Orthogonal Rail over diagonal Avenue Orthogonal Rail over diagonal GroundHighway Please note: Diagonal-based Puzzle Pieces are more temperamental. Extra care should be taken when interacting with these (placement, bulldozing etc.) Version 14 (29 November 2004) # All Ped Mall Tiles \u0026amp; Footbridges now contain YIMBY Effects. Specific details of the (YIMBY) Effects are as follows: Type of Effect (Magnitude, Radius) Landmark Effect (150,7) Park Effect (150,7) Mayor Rating Effect (5,8) Air Pollution Reduction (-150,3) Water Pollution Reduction (-100,3) Garbage Reduction (-10,0) Version 13 (15 November 2004) # ElevatedHighway to GroundHighway Extended Transition (This is actually an Interchange item). Missing Paths fixed for the Avenue Y-Stack, causing a delayed reaction/freezing with the game when placed. Avenue curve missing Pedestrian Path files fixed; this prevented Sims from being able to walk along an Avenue Curve, \u0026amp; potentially preventing them from accessing Mass Transit buildings along Diagonal Avenue. Lights added to Elevated Rail Dual/Double-Decker Networking Pieces. Diagonal Avenue to Diagonal Road transition. The Avenue tool \u0026amp;/or Road tool can be used to connect the two on the diagonal. Orthogonal OneWayRoad to Orthogonal Road transition. Diagonal OneWayRoad to Diagonal Road transition. Improvements made to Double-Diagonal OneWayRoad to Diagonal Avenue Transition \u0026amp; Double-Diagonal OneWayRoad to Diagonal GroundHighway Transition. The OneWayRoad tool itself can now be used as well, to join to Diagonal Avenue/GroundHighway. Various GroundHighway, ElevatedHighway, \u0026amp; Avenue; intersections \u0026amp;/or tiles; fixes \u0026amp;/or improvements, \u0026amp; are as follows; GroundHighways \u0026amp; ElevatedHighways can now be shifted over sidewards by just one tile in a single continuous stretch, thus removing the previous two tile restriction. This is applicable to both Orthogonal \u0026amp; Diagonal directions (try a little experimenting). Models, Textures, \u0026amp;/or Paths addressed as applicable for the following items (References to \u0026ldquo;S-Curve\u0026rdquo; can \u0026amp; do encompass a sideward shift of the network mentioned by one tile \u0026amp;/or two tiles, as applicable); PLEASE NOTE; that some of these may still have some minor issues with them.

Version 11 (4 September 2004) # U-Drive-It for Elevated Rail. Avenue Y-Stack. New radical Traffic Plugin file. See the Traffic Plugin file for full details. Several path file changes \u0026amp; fixes pertinent to UDI EI Rail, \u0026amp; various other file improvements. NAM now contains well over 2100 files (This is just the main NAM .dat file, \u0026amp; doesn\u0026rsquo;t take into account any of the other additional .dat files). Version 10 (14 August 2004) # Monorail has been changed, so that it no longer creates Air Pollution - Note: The \u0026quot; Traffic_Plugin\u0026quot; file used must be replaced in order to make use of this; Be sure to let the game [city/cities] run for a few months so that it can update this. All Custom preview models now contain a \u0026lsquo;red\u0026rsquo; [or bad] draw preview; that appears when a network item can not be placed. New intersections added; Orthogonal Elevated Highway x Double-Diagonal rail Orthogonal Elevated Highway x Double-Diagonal road Diagonal Elevated Highway x Double-Diagonal rail Diagonal Elevated Highway x Double-Diagonal road Orthogonal Elevated Rail x Double-Diagonal rail Orthogonal Elevated Rail x Double-Diagonal road Orthogonal Elevated Rail x Double-Diagonal OneWayRoad Diagonal Elevated Rail x Double-Diagonal rail Diagonal Elevated Rail x Double-Diagonal road Diagonal Elevated Rail x Double-Diagonal OneWayRoad Orthogonal Monorail x Double-Diagonal rail Orthogonal Monorail x Double-Diagonal road Orthogonal Monorail x Double-Diagonal OneWayRoad Diagonal Monorail x Double-Diagonal rail Diagonal Monorail x Double-Diagonal road Diagonal Monorail x Double-Diagonal OneWayRoads Orthogonal OneWayRoad x Double-Diagonal rail Version 9 (18 July 2004) # Double-Diagonal OneWayRoads - Note: The OneWayRoad Tool behaves slightly differently with these than with typical normal OneWayRoads. It\u0026rsquo;s highly advisable you do not use the \u0026ldquo;NoOneWayRoadArrows\u0026rdquo; Mod with these as it may cause problems. Using these may take some trial \u0026amp; error. Double-Diagonal OneWayRoads to Diagonal Avenue transition. Complete overhaul of all Ped Mall Tiles and all Puzzle Pieces - The previous Flat Terrain requirement is no longer necessary in order to use \u0026amp; place these, even when next to each other.

Please consult this file in conjunction with the Contents file for a list of Transit related items added for this mod to date. Pre-NAM Features (2003-2004, incorporated in NAM Version 1) # Textures changed for Street to Avenue intersections for better visual look. Made it possible to have double-wide diagonal rail transition into double wide orthogonal rail and vice-versa Created a work-around for a bug that prevented one-way roads from intersecting at a road-avenue t-intersection. In order to build this intersection, draw the one-way road last and draw it only to/from the tile next to the road/avenue intersection Made street intersections with road/avenue t-intersections easier. Draw the street last and draw it only to/from the tile next to the road/avenue intersection Made it possible for a orth 1-way road to intersect with a diag road/ave t-intersection Made it possible for a diag 1-way road to intersect with a orth road/ave t-intersection Fixed a visual bug that caused traffic to drive on the wrong side of the road on a diag ave-diag ave T-intersection. Fixed a bug that prevented U-turns on diagonal avenues that intersected or T-intersected with a diagonal road. Fixed a bug that prevented U-turns on orthagonal avenues that intersected with a diagonal avenue. Fixed a U-Drive-It bug for a ground rail intersection that previously did not allow you to switch the track while driving a train in U-Drive-It. On Avenue intersections between a straight (orthogonal) avenue and a diagonal avenue, Sims coming from the diagonal avenue could not turn left onto the straight avenue. This is fixed. The ability to dead end straight (orthogonal) roads or oneways into a diagonal avenue has been added. Thanks to Teirusu for the textures. Enjoy! Diagonal T interchanges have improved graphics. Sims could not drive straight through the road in a parallel road onramp to a ground highway when driving so the highway is on their right. This is fixed. One of the bugs causing cars to jump to different ramps on diagonal T ground highway interchanges was fixed. Avenue/oneway transitions now have custom graphics so they look better, textures compliments of Teirusu. When entering a ferry terminal in U-Drive it, your mission could fail instead of being redirected back onto the road. This is fixed, thanks to Karybdis. When driving over a ground level highway on an avenue overpass with onramps in the left lane, a U-Drive-it mission would fail. This is fixed. U turns immediately bordering avenue onramps on an avenue crossing a ground level highway could not be used by people just leaving or about to enter the highway. This is fixed. U turns immediately bordering avenue onramps on an avenue crossing an elevated highway could not be used by people just leaving or about to enter the highway. This is fixed. Half of the time Sims went underneath a diagonal elevated highway on a road with onramps, they could not turn left on the onramp. This has been fixed in Rush Hour. Half of the time Sims exited a diagonal elevated highway onto a diagonal road with offramps, they could not turn left on the road. This has been fixed in Rush Hour. Added the ability to end diagonal Oneways in a T-intersection with a perpendicular diagonal avenue. When Sims approached a diagonal avenue from a diagonal oneway, they could not turn left on the avenue. This is fixed. When Sims were driving on a diagonal avenue, they could not make a U-turn at half of the intersections with a perpendicular oneway road. This is fixed. Added the ability to end diagonal roads in a T-intersection with a perpendicular diagonal avenue. Fixed another avenue/oneway transition bug. It should be out of beta now, and fully operational with no further issues. Fixed avenue/oneway transitions so that U-Drive-it works in both lanes. Transitioning avenues to one way roads without an intersection. Previously, cars could not make some left turns onto a diagonal road when approaching from a straight one way road. This is now fixed. In three way monorail junctions, you could not change the switch\u0026rsquo;s direction. Driving the monorail over the switch would end your U-Drive-It mission instantly. This has been fixed. 3 Bugs fixed which prohibited cars from turning in various directions when a diagonal road crossed a straight avenue. Avenues dead ending into streets were completely impassable by any form of transit. Perpendicular road to one way intersections oriented on the diagonal did not allow left turns from the one way. The rest of the perpendicular road to road intersections oriented on the diagonal were fixed. Sims could not turn left from one of the roads coming from either direction. Updated some intersections between avenues and one way roads to show better automata. Diagonal Avenues with grid aligned (non-diagonal) ground train tracks crossing the avenue would not allow any cars to pass. A road to road diagonal T intersection was not allowing Sims to turn left onto one of the roads. Continuing an avenue with one way streets from an avenue/one way intersection did not allow any cars to pass through the avenue/one way intersection. Sims could not turn left at some diagonal avenues when approaching from a diagonal road. Elevated rail lines crossing ground highways prevented cars from travelling on the ground highway below. North or Southbound one way roads could not create T intersections with Westward avenues. Some intersections between avenues and one way roads did not allow correct turns. Avenues dead ending into one way roads did not allow any Sims to pass through the intersection. On half of the perpendicular road to road intersections oriented on the diagonal, Sims could not turn left from one of the roads coming from either direction. "}),e.add({id:7,href:"/docs/reference/technical-information/",title:"Technical Information",description:"Important information for NAM installations.",content:` The documentation on this page is out of date. This documentation was last updated with an old version of the NAM. It is in the process of being rewritten. While it is mainly intended for persons with the skills to open the NAM\u0026rsquo;s associated file(s), it contains important information about the game. Therefore the following information aims at the more technical side of things and should only be considered as an additional source of information about the mods\u0026rsquo; files \u0026amp;/or game. To install the mod, please refer to the Installation Instructions.
1. Known (Game) Issue(s) \u0026amp;/or Bugs # This section explains currently known game issues with SimCity 4\u0026rsquo;s Traffic/Network system that may be relevant to this mod. This is not all inclusive, \u0026amp; as such other issues may currently exist that are not covered here.
1.1 General # Because we do not have the same level of tools \u0026amp;/or degree of control over the game that Maxis does, some custom-based items may currently have Pathing, Graphical \u0026amp;/or other unknown/known issues with them, \u0026amp; exhibit behaviour that may not \u0026amp;/or should not occur normally. Unfortunately, some issues are beyond our control \u0026amp; as such may not be fixable at all. The following sections explains some of these issues in more detail
1.2 Networks # SimCity 4\u0026rsquo;s Networks, in general, exhibit a proximity behaviour when actively using the bulldozing tool \u0026amp;/or the different Networking Tools (Street, Road, Avenue, Rail, etc). When actively using these tools to bulldoze \u0026amp;/or draw a section of network, intersection tile \u0026amp;/or otherwise, this proximity behaviour can sometimes invoke issues, drawing bugs \u0026amp;/or otherwise in certain circumstances that may not otherwise occur normally. Such issues may also prevent the drawing of an intersection \u0026amp;/or section of network that might otherwise be possible to draw. This proximity behaviour is generally 3 to 4 tiles, but may be higher or lower in some cases.
Solution # While this proximity behaviour may be overcome in some cases by implementing the necessary rules for the game for such issues, the time it would take outweighs the benefits of implementing such rules in most cases (though some rules have been implemented for some of these). Often times, some issues may be rectified by bulldozing \u0026amp;/or re-drawing a section of network, intersection tile \u0026amp;/or otherwise, making sure the same action, series of actions, or set-up, that invoked the issue in the first place is not repeated.
1.3 Paths # SimCity 4\u0026rsquo;s Pathing system, in general, is controlled by a set of rules. For each tile of network that exists in the game, there is a Path file, \u0026amp; Paths (or Plotting Points) within that file, for the in-game tile. Unfortunately, some aspects of SimCity 4\u0026rsquo;s Pathing system are controlled by the games engine (or EXE). Because of this, some custom-based items may currently have UDI/Pathing issues with them, \u0026amp; exhibit commuter \u0026amp;/or UDI behaviour that may not \u0026amp;/or should not occur normally. Some Custom-Based Interchanges \u0026amp; Rail-Based networks, at least, are known to be affected by this to some degree.
1.4 Interchange-Base Related Items - Placement # There are two known critical bugs that exist with the game that are related to Interchange-Base RelatedItems, \u0026amp; the placement of these items. The following section explains these two bugs.
1.4.1 Placement \u0026amp; Zones # A bug exists that can potentially prevent the removal of a zones\u0026rsquo; Building/Lot. This same bug also has the potential to cause the game to crash. The exact precise cause of the issue is not known. The following outlines the general-case scenario in which these issues may arise \u0026amp; possible solution:
Items related to known issue: # Zones of any type (excluding Landfill) \u0026amp; the associated Buildings/Lots that spur from \u0026amp;/or sit on these zones. This can include residential, commercial, industrial zones, of all density levels, \u0026amp; their related Buildings \u0026amp;/or Lots. These related Buildings/Lots can include both Maxis originals \u0026amp; any custom made Buildings/Lots related to zones. Interchange Related Item(s) (IRI); this can include both Maxis originals \u0026amp; any custom made items that are interchange-base related, such as; Highway Overpasses; Ramps; Cloverleafs; PuzzlePieces; \u0026amp; other similar item(s). Route Query Tool \u0026amp;/or Normal Query Tool (in the case of the game crashing). Point of Issue Arising \u0026amp;/or Crashing: # If an IRI is built on already existing zones\u0026rsquo; Buildings/Lots, the removal of these buildings where the IRI is \u0026amp;/or was built may potentially no longer be possible to properly remove. Using either the Route Query Tool \u0026amp;/or Normal Query Tool on these affected Buildings/Lots, including even just hovering the Query Tool over any affected Lots, may also potentially cause the game to instantly crash to the desktop.
Solution: # In order for this bug not to be triggered in the first place, it is highly advisable that when placing an IRI that the terrain below the item be clear, \u0026amp; not contain any zones, \u0026amp;/or related buildings.
If by some reason the bug has been triggered, i.e. an IRI has been built on some zones, then be sure not to use either Query Tools on \u0026amp;/or over any of the zones\u0026rsquo; Buildings/Lots otherwise the game may instantly crash. In order to remove any buildings (that have been affected) that can not immediately be bulldozed/removed properly; re-zone the affected area, making sure there is still normal road access. Wait for a period of several (game) months, \u0026amp; then attempt to remove the affected Buildings/Lots. This may potentially enable the affected buildings/lots to be properly removed.
1.4.2 Placement \u0026amp; Transit Enabled Lots # An issue with the game which may cause the game to crash has been identified. At this time the exact precise cause of the issue is yet to be determined. The following outlines the general-case scenario in which the issue may cause the game to crash:
Items related to known issue: # Transit Enabled Lot(s) (TEL); this can include both Maxis originals \u0026amp; any custom made TEL. Interchange Related Item(s) (IRI); this can include both Maxis originals \u0026amp; any custom made items that are interchange-base related, such as; Highway Overpasses; Ramps; Cloverleafs; PuzzlePieces; \u0026amp; other similar item(s). Cursor of Interchange-base Related Item(s). Point of Crashing: # If the Cursor contains an IRI on it \u0026amp; then this Cursor is hovered over \u0026amp;/or clicked on (\u0026amp;/or repeated) a TEL, it can in some circumstantial cases cause the game to instantly crash to the desktop. Currently this is only known to occur if the IRIs\u0026rsquo; network on the Cursor is the same network with which the TEL is compatible with.
Solution: # Currently at this time, a full-proof work-around to the issue is not yet known. It is simply advised that users avoid moving the Cursor over a TEL if the Cursor has an IRI on it to minimize the chances of the game crashing. It is also advised that any TEL that exists in a city has its compatible network drawn right into/through the Lot, as this will also minimize the chances of the game crashing.
For more information on the above issue, see the following thread:Cursor + Transit Enabled Lot = Crashing.
The issue described above has been looked into, \u0026amp; currently at this time evidence seems to point to the problem existing within the games\u0026rsquo; executable itself, therefore there is nothing that can (currently) be done about this to completely \u0026amp; properly rid of the bug (unless Maxis decides to address the issue). The reason the issue has been mentioned here is because it has a probable significant impact on the use of this mod \u0026amp; those that use it.
2. Files used # 2.1 Existing files used indirectly in association with the Network Addon Mod # The Network Addon Mod currently relies on a number of the games existing files that you will already have.
These files include, but are not limited to, the following:
Various FSH files. Also known as Texture files. Various Exemplar files. Various S3D files. Also known as 3D files or Models. Various SC4Path files. Various Text based files. UI or User-Interface Files LUA Files. Also known as script files. Quite a number of the above files are also included in the Network Addon Mod and form part of Transit related Bugfixes \u0026amp;/or other Additional features.
If you\u0026rsquo;ve changed the look and/or contents of any of these above files, \u0026amp;/or used a mod or Bat/Lot file that has, there is a big chance that any/all of the features of this Mod will be affected. The extent of this is not something that can be told, it all really depends on what, if anything, may have been done to any of the above file types that are connected with the look \u0026amp;/or functionality of the contents of the Network Addon Mod.
2.2 Unique files used directly within the Network Addon Mod # The Network Addon Mod includes, depends on, and uses a number of files that are unique to games\u0026rsquo; engine. Because of this, certain files can not be replicated, changed, removed, \u0026amp;/or modified without any change, consequences \u0026amp;/or adverse affects on the game. These files include, but are not limited to, the following specific files [with Instance IDs]:
Cohort File(s) # ElTrain Cohort - 0x8BBF6D45 Exemplar File(s) # Traffic Simulator - 0xC9133286 Automata Tuning - 0x00000001 DirtRoad - 0x0000001A Dirt Road Placement Tuning Parameters - 0xEBE08CDA Traffic Commute Graph - 0x0000000B [This file is included with \u0026quot; _\u0026hellip;10xCommute\u0026quot; files] RUL File(s) # Highway - 0x00000001 Highway - 0x00000002 Rail - 0x00000005 Rail - 0x00000006 Road - 0x00000007 Road - 0x00000008 Street - 0x00000009 Street - 0x0000000A Avenue - 0x0000000D Avenue - 0x0000000E OneWayRoad - 0x00000011 OneWayRoad - 0x00000012 DirtRoad - 0x00000013 DirtRoad - 0x00000014 Ground Highway Rules - 0x00000017 Ground Highway Rules - 0x00000018 OneWayRoad Bridge Specializations - 0x0000100A Intersection Ordering - 0x10000000 Intersection Solutions - 0x10000001 Rule Overrides - 0x10000002 INI File(s) # Network Parameters - 0x8A5993B9 3. Path(s) (files) # 3.1 Puzzle Pieces \u0026amp; Overpasses # Because the game has Left-hand \u0026amp; Right-hand driving versions, covering all the different Pathing possibilities involved in relation to OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces, in an efficient \u0026amp; effective manner, sometimes makes them somewhat problematic to code/path for. For this reason some OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces, namely Intersection-Based related Puzzle Pieces, contain Bi-Directional Pathing for both forward and reverse Pathing files, or Right-hand \u0026amp; Left-hand drive. The same also applies to some Road \u0026amp; Avenue Intersection-Based Puzzle Pieces. This was done as a preventative measure to overcome any complication issues that may have arisen with players using the items of this mod that are associated with, namely OneWayRoad, Puzzle Pieces, with having any functional \u0026amp;/or just general problems with them. As a result players may notice some pathing \u0026amp;/or automata oddities \u0026amp;/or issues with/when using these particular items of the mod.
The above paragraph typically does not apply to Puzzle Pieces or Overpasses that contain Directional Arrows. Puzzle Pieces \u0026amp; Overpasses that contain Directional Arrows should function properly as they should, typically without any Pathing/Automata oddities, as long as they are placed \u0026amp; linked up properly according to their Directional Arrows.
3.2 U-Drive-It \u0026amp;/for EI Rail # There exists some game limitations with which we had to work with in order to make UDI for EI Rail possible. Unfortunately, for certain aspects of UDI for a Rail-based network, the game will only recognise certain paths for the track switches (Track switches are what make it possible to go in different directions at junctions during UDI). Because of this, UDI EI Rail \u0026amp;/or EI Rail Path files contains a replicated set of paths; one set of paths for its own original intended network; \u0026amp; one set for the UDI EI Rail mode. The set of paths for UDI EI Rail mode are technically ground-rail-based pathing. Because of this, it should be possible to take a UDI passenger train \u0026amp;/or UDI freight train from ground rail to EI Rail using a Transit Enabled Lot (\u0026amp; visa-versa for EI Rail Train to ground rail). The Transit Enabled Lot would have to contain special custom path files though, in order to achieve this. This however, is currently outside the scope of this mod. |
4. Network Hierarchy # There exists a hierarchy in the game with the different Networks. The following is a guideline on the hierarchy of the different above ground Network types:
[In order of Top of the hierarchy to the bottom of the hierarchy]
Monorail Network Elevated Rail Network Highway Network Rail Network GroundHighway Network Avenue Network OneWayRoad Network Road Network Street Network ANT Network (RHW Network) The higher up the hierarchy a network is, a higher priority is given to the network when drawing one network over another (in a parallel overlapping fashion). For this reason it is not possible to drag a network at the lower end of the hierarchy over a network that is higher up the hierarchy, \u0026amp; for the network to be converted to that of the lower hierarchical network. This is something defined in the games engine and it is highly doubtful that it can be changed. Apart from this though, generally this hierarchy should not cause any problems, unless you are a modder trying to mod Networks(s) \u0026amp;/or associated files.
5. Lots # This mod does not contain Lots \u0026amp;/or Lot [Exemplar] files at all, such as those found in Buildings Lots; in any way what so ever.
6. ANT Item # The ANT item that Maxis left incomplete/inactive in the game, with the technical name of \u0026ldquo;DirtRoad\u0026rdquo;, was an optional plugin that has been superseeded by the Rural Highway Mod (RHW). The complete functionality of the ANT Plugin has been transferred to the RHW and is not longer supported by the NAM. For more information about the RHW, please refer to the RHW readme file.
7. NAM ID Conventions # This section briefly covers the file conventions that the NAM typically follows for its custom content (where applicable). These conventions are guidelines only \u0026amp; as such some pre-existing items pre-date when these guidelines were established \u0026amp; may not follow the conventions. Also; some limited exceptions \u0026amp;/or variations may apply or (need to) exist due to functional, technical \u0026amp;/or internal housekeeping purposes.
Most conventions are governed by or have been influenced by Maxis conventions. These conventions mostly apply to Network related files, \u0026amp; while it is not completely comprehensive, it does cover InstanceID conventions, Network conventions, \u0026amp;/or any other conventions that may be applicable or appropriate for this section at this time. These conventions encompass S3D Model files, SC4Path files, Network-Based Exemplar files, Network-Based FSH files, Network-Based EffectDir files, Network-Based Prop related files, \u0026amp; possibly others.
GroupID designations: GroupIDs of the various items \u0026amp;/or areas of the game are typically used as flags for functional purposes \u0026amp; are usually governed by Maxis file formats. InstanceID designations for Interchange base items: 0x5NDDD##Z InstanceID designations for Non-Interchange base items. 0x5FNDDDWZ InstanceID designations for Bridges \u0026amp; Network Props (like custom Traffic Lights): 0x5NDDDZR0 N = Network designation. See table below for these. DDD = MonthMonthDayDay in full extended decimal form (with all leading zeros) converted into hex. Where 2004 is the baseyear \u0026amp; each subsequent year 12+ Month per year should be added to MonthMonth before converting to hex. For multiple items on a set date, increase/decrease accordingly based on the initial date. # = remaining portion of hex making up the whole InstanceID. This portion of the InstanceID typically based on the base InstanceID of the item. W= Wealth. This typically only applies to referenced S3D files \u0026amp; FSH files (where applicable). Z = Zoom level. This typically only applies to referenced S3D files \u0026amp; FSH files (where applicable). R = Rotation. This typically only applies to referenced S3D files \u0026amp; FSH files (where applicable).

Left Hand Version Rail Networks Fix # This section is an extension from the above section that deals with NAM ID Conventions. The conventions in this section however only apply to SC4Path files.
This section deals with the \u0026lsquo;Left-Hand Version Rail Networks fix\u0026rsquo; included in the Network Addon Mod.
Right-Hand Drive Version versus Left-Hand Drive Version; SimCity 4 path files were written with Right-Hand Drive players in mind. Nearly all Path files were written with Right-Hand drive as the default. This applies to road-based networks such as street, road, avenue, \u0026amp; rail-based networks such as rail, monorail \u0026amp; elevated rail. For Left-Hand Drive versions, the game automatically reverses all road based pathing (or \u0026ldquo;Car\u0026rdquo; pathing), with the exception of onewayroads. The game does not however, apply this same automatic reversal for rail-based networks; and this is why this fix has, in part, been created.
This fix makes use of the games INI Network file that enables manual reversing of path files specifically for Left Hand Versions through the use of special InstanceID masking \u0026amp; path file replacement, upon which the exe automatically scans at runtime. Unfortunately, current tests show that the Subway network is an exception to this. For this reason these paths have been included in an additional Plugin for Left-Hand versions. This extra additional Plugin also contains other files for Left-Hand versions. This extra dat Plugin should only be used for Left Hand drive versions. See the Installation Instructions regarding the installation of this extra Plugin file.
This particular fix will impact on Left-Hand Drive Versions. Because of the necessary adjustments that have been made, this fix will subsequently impact on Transit Enabled Lots, for Left Hand Versions. The following explains this impact in more detail.
Transit Enabled Lots # Transit Enabled Lots that do not specify an actual Path file \u0026amp;/or just use simple RUL Flags in its LotConFig property, then it should not be affected \u0026amp; no change should need to be made. However, Transit Enabled Lots that actually specify path file(s) in any of their LotConFig Properties will most likely be affected \u0026amp; may need modifying. Transit Enabled Lots of this type will typically have 0x00000007 type LotConFig properties (or in other words; 0x00000007 as the first value), \u0026amp; have 16+ values for the LotConFig property, specifying actual path files (i.e. InstanceID) in the 16th+ value. To overcome any adverse affects this fix may cause, for Transit Enabled Lots for Left Hand Versions, please read the following very carefully;
Transit Enabled Lots specifying Path files will already have the necessary path file(s) for Right Hand versions. For Left Hand Versions though, the path file(s) may need to be replicated, IIDs changed, \u0026amp; the Rail-RelatedPathing reversed for Left Hand versions (\u0026amp; only rail-related pathing. Car-based pathing should not be reversed. There may exist some very limited exceptions to this). So in essence there will be two sets of Path files; one for Right Hand versions \u0026amp; one for Left Hand versions. Both the Right-Hand Version Path file(s) InstanceID \u0026amp; Left Hand Version Path file(s) InstanceID then need to be in a particular InstanceID range(s), in order to work properly for both Right Hand \u0026amp; Left Hand players. The following ranges are valid Path File Instance ID conversion ranges in which the game will automatically use the replacement Path files in the case of Left Hand Drive Versions;
(Other IID reversal ranges exist, but the following ones are the main ones. Please see the INI file itself for a raw \u0026amp; thorough breakdown).
Short abbreviated version
0x0N###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x4N###### 0x5N###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x7N###### 0x5FN##### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x7FN##### Where \u0026lsquo;N\u0026rsquo; = Network designation.
Long version (actual specific IID ranges)
Default Path File(s) \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Replacement Path File(s) Right-Hand Version \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Left-Hand Version 0x03###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x43###### 0x53###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x73###### 0x5F3##### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x7F3##### 0x08###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x48###### 0x58###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x78###### 0x5F8##### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x7F8##### 0x0D###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x4D###### 0x5D###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x7D###### 0x5FD##### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x7FD##### 0xEA###### \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x4A###### # = remaining hex of the InstanceID of the Path file(s). This portion of the Instance ID should be exactly the same for both Right-Hand \u0026amp; Left-Hand versions. As some examples:
0x 0 3031500 \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x 4 3031500 ~ these are actual path files found in the NAM \u0026amp;/or the games own files 0x 5F8 32900 \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x 7F8 32900 ~ these are actual path files found in the NAM 0x 5D 123900 \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 0x 7D 123900 ~ in the case of a Rail-based Bridge All Rail-Related IID Ranges are covered \u0026amp; reversed for Left Hand Drive versions. Any Path file(s) that fall within the ranges listed above, regardless of the type of Paths it contains, will be scanned by the exe, replacement Path File(s) used \u0026amp; then reversed (NOTE: If a replacement Path file does not exist, the tile in question may not function). Since the exe does not actually reverse rail-based networks, it will simply use the Replacement Path file(s) as is for Left Hand Versions. If there exists car pathing in the replacement file(s) though, then the exe will only reverse the car pathing portion of the path file for Left Hand Drive versions. |
9. End Notes # A.1 # Commute Graph Exemplar: This has only been included in files with the \u0026quot; _\u0026hellip;10xCommute\u0026quot; in its name. The only reason for this is to try and off-set the Commute Graph display so as to give a more representable idea of the commute time being experienced [against/compared to what people might usually consider/expect]. It\u0026rsquo;s highly advisable that any time you change which Traffic Plugin file is used, that you give the game ample time to update everything/anything related \u0026amp;/or connected to the Paths/Commutes. Twelve months game time, at least, should be given. This time will vary though depending on city size, game options, \u0026amp;/or computer system.
A.2 # Please note that some files have been replicated, used, \u0026amp;/or referenced multiply times by different items \u0026amp;/or areas of the files, including referencing the games own original files. One such example of this is some of the Puzzle Pieces; which basically makes use of the overpasses files [not necessarily all of them though].
A.3 # It is highly advisable that you do not change the contents of these files, nor change any of the files TGI, not unless you know very well what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. Since modifying any of these files may cause the file(s) \u0026amp;/or fixes/features of the Network Addon Mod \u0026amp;/or other items not to function properly, not at all, \u0026amp;/or not as intended.

The contents of this document may reference older, obsolete NAM content. It, however, can still be used as a reference guide. Note:* The Automata Plugins are also referred as Automata Controllers, like other NAM files where only one file can be installed at a time.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU ONLY USE ONE OF THE \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;Automata_Plugin\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; FILES, \u0026amp; ONE ONLY. The NAM Installer should ensure this.
The information below explains which \u0026quot; \u0026hellip;Automata_Plugin\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; files contain what changes. See the notes at the end before using any file.
The \u0026quot; \u0026hellip;Automata_Plugin\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; files have a naming scheme according to the following below:
\u0026quot; _\u0026hellip;Standard\u0026quot; = Default Maxis values, except: It has been slightly modified to take into account the RealHighway network\u0026rsquo;s speed. It has been changed to give more of an accurate representation of the speed the vehicles are travelling at on the RealHighway network, compared to the other networks. Nothing else in this file is changed.
\u0026quot; \u0026hellip;Automata24\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; = Automata, of most kinds, is displayed for most of the 24-Hour Sim day.
\u0026quot; \u0026hellip;Radical\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; = The following changes [increases/decreases]:
Vehicle Lifespan Range: Min:50, Max:380 Ped Lifespan Range: Min:128, Max:255 Sim Prop Anim range: Min:25, Max:150 Max Peds per second [per tile]:100 Max Vehicles per second [per tile]:250 Max Peds [at any one time]:2500 Max Vehicles [at any one time]:5000 Max Aircraft [at any one time]:35 Max Watercraft [at any one time]:100 Sims per Train Car:100 Sims per Bus:80 Commute Train Length: Min:5, Max:15 Freight Train Length: Min:9, Max:25 Maximum level of Freight Trucks Cut-off [Industrial City Jobs]:500,000 Curve speed multiplier:0.7 [of normal speed] Population Occupant Trip Radius [in tiles]:10 Moving Van Frequency [new residence]:2 Hill/Slope speed multiplier [% of normal speed when going up/down a hill]: 0.20 Simulation Speed multiplier-For Cheetah Speed only [this only applies if you use \u0026ldquo;Variable Speed Automata\u0026rdquo; in the Games Options]:8 Spawn/Recall for:
Streets: 40%/30%,10%/40% Roads: 50%/30%,10%/40% Avenues: 60%/30%,10%/40% Highways: 85%/60%,10%/30% \u0026ndash;Add Information about Persistent options here\u0026ndash;
Note: Spawn/Recall is the percent chance/capacity at which more automata are added/removed for/from a tile. First set of numbers represents the percent chance at the specified capacity at which automata will be added; the second set is the percent chance at the specified capacity at which automata will be removed.
Additional Notes # The file names explain what files contain what changes \u0026amp; are all based on the \u0026quot; _\u0026hellip;Standard\u0026quot; file above. If a file name contains two [or more] of the above names, then that means it contains those changes as detailed above.
You do not actually need/have to use any of the \u0026quot; \u0026hellip;Automata_Plugin\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; file if you do not want to. It is not really imperative to the Network Addon Mod that a \u0026quot; \u0026hellip;Automata_Plugin\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; file is used. If you choose not to use one of the \u0026quot; \u0026hellip;Automata_Plugin\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; files though, then the Automata on the RealHighway network will not be represented fairly/accurately as intended.
Automata: Automata are basically animations; a \u0026ldquo;visual\u0026rdquo; representation. So while they represent the underlying Traffic happening [to some degree only really], they are only animations, and as such any of the changes made above do not actually change any functional aspects of networks capacities/speeds/commutes. Automata, being generated as a representation of statistical data, also may be prone to bizarre behavior that would defy real-world traffic logic. Due to the nature of how they are programmed, this is not something the NAM Team can address.

The contents of this document may reference older, obsolete NAM content. It, however, can still be used as a reference guide. Some additional features, such as the RealHighways (RHW), Network Widening Mod (NWM), RealRailways (RRW), High Speed Rail Project (HSRP), Turn Lanes, and PedMalls are covered in the Feature Guides section of this documentation.
Additional Overpasses # Fully functional Overpasses. The following additional Overpasses are now included with this mod.
Note: Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, all of these Overpasses only exist for the game when following the game\u0026rsquo;s square grid, \u0026amp; not against it.
Road Overpasses # Menu button contains the following overpasses:
Road over Road Road over Rail Road over Street Road over OneWayRoad Road over Avenue OneWayRoad Overpasses # Menu button contains the following overpasses:
Note: OneWayRoad Overpasses now contain Directional Arrows \u0026amp; should be placed accordingly
OneWayRoad over OneWayRoad OneWayRoad over Rail OneWayRoad over Street OneWayRoad over Road OneWayRoad over Avenue OneWayRoad over Ground Highway [this is without ramps] Avenue Overpasses # Menu button contains the following overpasses:
Avenue over Avenue Avenue over Rail Avenue over Street Avenue over Road Avenue over OneWayRoad Other additional overpasses
[Currently, there is no Menu Button for these. If the conditions are right, the game will build these ones automatically when using the applicable network tools to draw them]
Elevated Rail over Elevated Highway Elevated Rail over Monorail Monorail over Elevated Highway Ground Rail over Ground Highway Orthogonal Elevated Highway (Raised) over Diagonal Elevated Highway (Flat) Orthogonal Ground Highway (Raised) over Diagonal Ground Highway (Flat) More overpasses may [or may not] be added with future updates.
To build these Overpasses etc, either select them from the Menu or just simply drag one network type over the other. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see a particular Overpass in the Menu, then use the Network tools to create them. For Example: build a stretch of Monorail track; then using the Elevated Rail Network tool, drag a long-enough stretch of Elevated Rail over the Monorail Network [like: \u0026lsquo;+\u0026rsquo;] and the Elevated Rail over Monorail overpass will build automatically if the conditions are right.
With some of the Overpasses, especially where OneWayRoads are involved, it may be a little difficult sometimes to actually be able to build the overpass. So some patience, trial \u0026amp; error may be needed.
Each of the different Menu Buttons for these overpasses works by using the HOME/END and TAB key(s) on your keyboard. HOME/END rotates the overpasses on the cursor [where possible], and TAB (\u0026amp;/or SHIFT+TAB) cycles through the different overpasses that belongs to that menu button. When you TAB from one overpass to another, the type of overpass is displayed in the TEXT on the cursor itself [where possible].
Overpasses come under the same scope as being Interchange-base Related Item(s).
Additional Interchanges # The following Custom Interchanges are now included with this mod:
Custom Interchange(s) # Includes the following Custom Interchanges:
Ground Highway Trumpet Interchange Ground Highway Partial Y Interchange Ground Highway Y Interchange Orthogonal Elevated Highway by Diagonal Elevated Highway Interchange Elevated Highway over Ground Highway Stack Elevated Highway - 3 Leaf Clover Elevated Highway - 2 Leaf Clover-Adjacent Elevated Highway - 2 Leaf Clover-Opposite Elevated Highway - 1 Leaf Clover Elevated Highway \u0026lt;~\u0026gt; Ground Highway Extended Transition \u0026lsquo;T\u0026rsquo; Highway OnSlope Puzzle Piece Orthogonal/Diagonal Double \u0026lsquo;T\u0026rsquo; Highway OnSlope Puzzle Piece Orthogonal/Diagonal Highway OnSlope Puzzle Piece Orthogonal/Diagonal Ground Highway 45-Curve Elevated Highway 45-Curve Additionally, Elevated Highway over Tram-in-Avenue Orthogonal/Diagonal interchanges can be found at the end of the Perpendicular Ramps button. There currently exist some Path issues with some of these interchanges. Unfortunately, for technical reasons some of these path issues are not possible to fix at all.
Each of the different Custom Interchanges is currently contained in the one Menu Button in the Highway Menu. Use the HOME/END and TAB key(s) on your keyboard. HOME/END rotates the item on the cursor [where possible], and TAB (\u0026amp;/or SHIFT+TAB) cycles through the different items that belongs to that menu button. When you TAB from one item to another, the type is displayed in the TEXT on the cursor itself [where possible].
Interchanges come under the same scope as being Interchange-base Related Item(s).
Additional [Highway] Ramps # The following ramps are now included with this mod:
Note: Unless mentioned otherwise; these ramps only exist for the game when following the game\u0026rsquo;s square grid, \u0026amp; not against it.
Single-Sided Perpendicular Ramps # Menu button contains the following ramps:
Elevated Highway OnRamp-Road Elevated Highway OffRamp-Road Elevated Highway Straight OnRamp-Road Elevated Highway Straight OffRamp-Road Elevated Highway Straight OnRamp-OneWayRoad Elevated Highway Straight OffRamp-OneWayRoad Elevated Highway OnRamp-OneWayRoad Forward Elevated Highway OffRamp-OneWayRoad Forward Elevated Highway OnRamp-OneWayRoad Reverse Elevated Highway OffRamp-OneWayRoad Reverse Single-Sided Parallel Ramps # Menu button contains the following ramps:

The only way to fix this is to use the NAM Left Hand Drive Controller, installed as part of the NAM Left Hand Drive Plugin.
Other Ramps # [Currently, there is no Menu Button for this. If the conditions are right, the game will prompt you for these one(s)]
Elevated Highway Avenue Orthogonal One Sided Dual Ramp [If you have a UK version of the game, or left-hand side driving; then some of these Ramps above will be the opposite. i.e. OnRamp becomes OffRamp. OffRamp becomes OnRamp. Some of the names above have been done intentionally for a reason. They are all different types of Ramps, for now it was just figured the best way to deal with some of them was to name them in this particular manner for easier identifying in-game. This may change though].
Each of the different Menu Buttons for these ramps works by using the HOME/END and TAB key(s) on your keyboard. HOME/END rotates the item on the cursor [where possible], and TAB (\u0026amp;/or SHIFT+TAB) cycles through the different items that belongs to that menu button. When you TAB from one item to another, the type is displayed in the TEXT on the cursor itself [where possible].
Ramps come under the same scope as being Interchange-base Related Item(s).
Puzzle Pieces # The following Puzzle Pieces are now included with this Mod:
Please note: Many Puzzle Piece items now contain a Diagonal component (where applicable) \u0026amp; cover many possible configurations, with either the lower \u0026amp;/or upper portion of the Puzzle Piece.
Diagonal Street Helper Pieces # Menu button contains the following FLEX and Puzzle Pieces:
Construction Piece (long version) [FLEX] Construction Piece (medium version) [FLEX] Construction Piece (short version) [FLEX] Diagonal Street Puzzle Piece Diagonal Street Puzzle Piece (Switch right) Diagonal Street Puzzle Piece (Switch left) Road Puzzle Pieces # Menu button contains the following Puzzle Pieces:

This red line indicates that the puzzle piece does also allow creating a Flexible Underpass across the canal.
More puzzle pieces may [or may not] be added with future updates.
Each of the different Menu Buttons for these Puzzle Pieces works by using the HOME/END and TAB key(s) on your keyboard. HOME/END rotates the Puzzle Piece on the cursor [where possible], and TAB (\u0026amp;/or SHIFT+TAB) cycles through the different Puzzle Pieces that belongs to that menu button item. When you TAB from one Puzzle Piece to another, the type of Puzzle Piece is displayed in the TEXT on the cursor itself [where possible]. Puzzle Pieces must be built manually from the Menu.
So what are Puzzle Pieces? # (Please note: That there are some exceptions to the following section. Typical Puzzle Piece placement rules as described \u0026amp; depicted further below do not apply to every single Puzzle Piece item. Some Puzzle Piece based items may differ slightly in their placement \u0026amp;/or use due to their design. The following section is only meant as a guide.)
Puzzle Pieces are essentially like jigsaw puzzles; many smaller pieces making up a bigger picture. Puzzle Pieces came about as a result of Overpasses, from the previous section. With Overpasses you are restricted to having an Overpass at a set length, with the overpass only passing over one network. With using Puzzle Pieces though this set length can be overcome; and you can now build extended Overpasses [extended overpasses must be built manually using the Puzzle Pieces]. You can also have two or more networks, whether they\u0026rsquo;re the same or not, going underneath extended overpass(es); these too must be built manually using the Puzzle Pieces. Puzzle Pieces now also have raised intersections, which should increase their flexibility even more.
Puzzle Pieces can typically be placed on uneven \u0026amp;/or unlevel terrain; including placing Puzzle Pieces next to each other on uneven/unlevel terrain. The more level the terrain is though, the less the Puzzle Piece Model has to conform to the terrain, thus giving a much better visual look. This also includes being able to place Puzzle Pieces on water (any Puzzle Pieces placed on water will still function properly \u0026amp; carry commuters, as long as everything is linked up properly). Note: That this is by design that this is possible.
Intersection-Based Puzzle Pieces: Where there exists Intersection Puzzle Pieces like \u0026ldquo;Road x Road/OneWayRoad\u0026rdquo;, this is an Intersection Puzzle Piece aimed at and primarily for Road + Intersection, but is compatible \u0026amp; will work with OneWayRoad Puzzle Piece connections. Where there exists Intersection Puzzle Pieces like \u0026ldquo;Avenue x Road/OneWayRoad\u0026rdquo;, this is an Intersection Puzzle Piece primarily for Avenue intersection, and is aimed for use with Road \u0026amp;/or OneWayRoad Puzzle Piece connections. In other words, these intersection-based puzzle pieces are flexible. Because of this flexibility though, some minor oddities may occur (please see Technical Notes for more details regarding path oddities).
How To Use Puzzle Pieces? # Most Puzzle Pieces had to be made in a very particular way. For this reason some people may have a little trouble using them sometimes. There is a particular method in which Puzzle Pieces must generally be used, otherwise they may not function properly as intended. Puzzle Pieces that have a dual network, for example Road over Road Puzzle Piece \u0026amp;/or Road over Avenue Puzzle Piece, must typically be placed on top of an existing section of the network in order to implement and use them in the game properly. This is something that may take some practice, a little patience, and some trial and error to do.
Auto-Resolving \u0026amp; how it can help # Because some Puzzle Piece network buttons, especially OneWayRoad Puzzle Piece menu button, contain numerous items on the Home/End keys, trying to find the item you want for a given situation can be impractical. Auto-Resolvinghelps overcome this impracticality (thanks to Maxis!). Auto-resolving occurs when hovering the cursor of an interchange-based related item, such as Puzzle Pieces or interchange items, over existing sections of (non-reserved) network \u0026amp; Tabbing \u0026amp;/or Cycling through the different items attached to an Interchange-Based Related Menu Button. The game will automatically resolve only appropriate possible items for a given network in a given situation, when pressing the Tab \u0026amp;/or Home/End keyboard keys. Puzzle Pieces involving a two-tiled network, such as avenue \u0026amp; ground highway, may require the cursor be moved across the two-tiled area of the network when using the Home/End keys to access any/all of the possible configurations an item contains. There are some exceptions to this Auto-Resolving ability for some items, which typically depends on an items internal design. If in doubt, please experiment.
Diagonal-Based Puzzle Pieces # Many of the Network Puzzle Piece Menu Buttons \u0026amp;/or items now contain their Diagonal equivalent. In order to access Diagonal Puzzle Pieces, select a Puzzle Piece menu item \u0026amp; use the Home/End keyboard keys to rotate an item (where applicable). Note that not all items contain a Diagonal equivalent.
The same \u0026ldquo;How To Use\u0026rdquo; principles described above \u0026amp; depicted below apply to Diagonal-Based Puzzle Pieces, as they do with normal (straight-based) Puzzle Pieces. Diagonal-Based Puzzle Pieces though may take a little bit more practice, patience, and trial and error to fully utilise. Please note that all of the Diagonal-Based Puzzle Pieces have specifically been made the way they are for a reason - their (unorthodox) design makes them much more interchangeable with each other \u0026amp; all the rest of the puzzle pieces, thus making them much more versatile.
The following tries to illustrate how Puzzle Pieces must be used in order for them to work properly as intended:
You must have 3 Tiles of Street laid down already before you build the Road over Street Puzzle Piece. It must be done like this. With Puzzle Pieces that are 1x2, 2x1, or 2x2 etc tiles, the arrangement \u0026amp; set-up may be a little different but the same principles as this apply.
OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces: How to use? # Because OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces flow of traffic only travels in any one direction, using them is a little different from other Puzzle Pieces. The same principles above apply to OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces. The only difference is the Starting \u0026amp; Ending Pieces. If you use \u0026ldquo;OneWayRoad Starting Piece - ON\u0026rdquo; on one end of an extended overpass, you must use \u0026ldquo;OneWayRoad Ending Piece - OFF\u0026rdquo; on the other end of the extended overpass.
Many of the OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces now contain Directional Arrows to assist with their placement \u0026amp; general use. OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces should be placed \u0026amp; linked together according to these Directional Arrows, where applicable, in order for them to work \u0026amp; function properly. Fail to do so may result with whole sections of raised OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces not working properly at all.
The following gives an example illustration on how this should be done with OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces in order for them to work properly as intended:
GLR Puzzle Pieces: How to use? # Ground Light Rail (GLR) Puzzle Pieces are basically Elevated Rail tracks on ground level. Use the Elevated to Ground Light Rail transition to connect both. It is recommended that you use Draggable GLR instead of GLR Puzzle Pieces whenever possible. Since the NAM doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain lots, you have to install GLR stations separately. vester_DK has created a list of all available GLR stations in the Simtropolis forums.
Draggable GLR: How to use it? # Draggable GLR can be used similar like the in-game network tools. You have to place a special starter puzzle piece first that will indicate the direction of the draggable GLR. Use the in-game el-rail tool for dragging GLR tracks. Please note: Due to certain restrictions, the preview still shows up in the same height as the el-rail tracks. At the moment, this cannot be changed.
With draggable GLR, you have almost the same liberties as with any other draggable network. For some special cases it\u0026rsquo;s still necessary to use puzzle pieces, though, such as a GLR x El-Rail intersection.The existing GLR stations need to be updated for placing them directly onto draggable GLR. A patch with updated files is available as a separate download. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to bulldoze the existing GLR network or existing stations in your city, and the patch won\u0026rsquo;t affect stations that have been placed already, however you might want to update your GLR setup to draggable GLR anyway, since it\u0026rsquo;s more flexible and less prone to crashes. You can connect GLR puzzle pieces and draggable GLR with the starter puzzle pieces (which also serve as transition pieces) at any time.
Limitations # Puzzle Pieces currently have some limitations \u0026amp;/or known issues with them, and are as follows:
The Data View Map Congestions \u0026amp; Data View Map Volume Traffic Overlays do not always appear fully on all the different Puzzle Pieces (there is a reason for this). They will still show up in the Data View Map itself though.
Puzzle Pieces come under the same scope as being Interchange-base Related Item(s).

More Dual/Double-Decker Network Pieces may or may not be added with future updates.
The above Dual/Double-Decker Network Pieces works by using the HOME/END and TAB key(s) on your keyboard. HOME/END rotates the Piece on the cursor [where possible], and TAB cycles through the different Pieces that belongs to that menu button. When you TAB from one Piece to another, the type of Piece is displayed in the TEXT on the cursor itself [where possible].
What is Dual/Double-Decker Networking? # Dual/Double-Decker Networking is similar to Puzzle Pieces, essentially allowing Two Networks to run parallel one on top of the other along the same stretch of tile(s), simultaneously, allowing more than one form of Transport to use the same stretch of tile(s) at the same time for commuting purposes.
Note: When using this item in front of zones, it is best if an area is zoned first before laying this item down, otherwise the zones may not face the direction you want. If in doubt, please experiment.
Limitations # The limitations for Dual/Double-Decker Network Pieces are the same as per Puzzle Pieces above.
Dual/Double-Decker Network Pieces come under the same scope as being Interchange-base Related Item(s).
U-Drive-It # U-Drive-It (UDI) for Elevated Rail (EI Rail) has now been included with this mod. Currently, only \u0026ldquo;Free Drive Mode\u0026rdquo; is available for Elevated Rail Train/Station.
Where to find? # UDI for EI Rail is located under the \u0026ldquo;U Drive It\u0026rdquo; Panel, in the \u0026ldquo;Earned Land Vehicles\u0026rdquo; menu, half-way down the menu just before the Menu Icon for Monorail UDI.
How to use? # In order to use UDI EI Rail, you need to build an Elevated Rail Train Station. This will be the case regardless for a new city or an existing city. In other words; even in existing cities where there are already existing Elevated Rail Train Stations, you will still need to build an Elevated Rail Train station in order to be able to access UDI for EI Rail. If in doubt, please experiment.
Currently; UDI for EI Rail is not intended for use on \u0026ldquo;EI Rail-to-subway transitions\u0026rdquo;. Unfortunately, the game may still try to start UDI for EI Rail from an \u0026ldquo;EI Rail-to-subway transitions\u0026rdquo;. This side-affect is by design that this occurs.
UDI -cross platforms # With the advent of UDI for EI Rail, it should now be possible to take a UDI passenger train \u0026amp;/or UDI freight train, onto EI Rail via a custom made Transit Enabled Lot connecting ground rail to EI Rail. It should also now be possible to take a UDI EI Train onto ground rail via the same method. Just so long as the Custom Transit Enabled Lot has been made properly \u0026amp; with proper custom paths.
For more information regarding UDI EI Rail, please see the Technical Notes.
Additional Intersections \u0026amp; Junctions # This section lists Intersections, Junctions, \u0026amp;/or Network possibility types that have been made possible \u0026amp;/or are included in this mod \u0026amp;/or have had adjustments/fixes applied to them. All of the intersections, junctions \u0026amp;/or network possibility types in this section are achieved in-game using the standard Network tools, where applicable. i.e. Highway Tools, Avenue Tool, Road Tool, \u0026amp; so on.
Note: This list is not all inclusive \u0026amp; should only be considered as a guideline. Due to the multitude of items for this section, some items may exist that are currently not listed here or are not known, \u0026amp; as such this list may change. If in doubt, please experiment. Some known/unknown drawing, pathing \u0026amp;/or UDI issues may also exist with some items listed in this section.
Legend # Junction typically has the same meaning as Intersection, but may also encompass non-intersection type junctions. Orthogonal = Straight or follows the Grid. Diagonal = does not follow the grid. Curve = where the network changes from orthogonal to diagonal, visa versa or other similar variation. S-Curve = where the network changes from orthogonal to diagonal back to orthogonal in the shortest tile distance possible, visa versa or other similar variation. Corner = 90 degree turn or corner. + Junction = a four way intersection. T-Junction = a three way intersection. Offsplit = where a network comes off of the Curve of a network. The lists below are broken into two main Groups \u0026amp; items are listed by Network Set(s) according to Network Hierarchy, from lowest to highest (approximately). Group One involves only one network that have had additional intersections/etc items added for them i.e. no other networks are involved. Group Two is where more than one network is involved.
Group One # Items in this section only involve one network.
The items in this group are not in any particular or specific format.
Street # Roundabouts. To trigger the initial Street roundabout, you must draw a Street Circle in a 2x2 tile area. There currently exists many variations with one, two, three \u0026amp;/or four orthogonal \u0026amp;/or Diagonal Streets stemming from this initial 2x2 tile area. NOTE: Requires an additional Plugin. See Installation Instructions for details.
Diagonals. This requires 5 or more tiles to be zig zagged, like a set of steps or stairs, before the diagonals are triggered. Note: Requires an additional Plugin. See Installation Instructions for details.
You can also build a diagonal street via Diagonal Street helper puzzle pieces which can be used to build diagonal streets on sloped terrains or intersections. There are two types of them: normal puzzle pieces and construction puzzle pieces.
Road # Road Turning Lanes. Note: Requires an additional Plugin. See Installation Instructionsfor details. OneWayRoad # Double Diagonal
Roundabouts. To trigger the initial OneWay roundabout, you must draw a OneWayRoad Circle in a 3x3 tile area. There currently exists many variations with one, two, three \u0026amp;/or four orthogonal \u0026amp;/or Diagonal OneWayRoads stemming from this initial 3x3 tile area. Note: Requires an additional Plugin. See Installation Instructions for details.
Avenue # The Avenue Tool/Network has been significantly modified, is much more flexible \u0026amp; now contains well over an additional 35+ new intersections, junctions \u0026amp;/or set-up possibility types, some of which we may not even be aware of yet. The listings for this section is to primarily give users an idea of what kind of junctions are now possible, as there may exist various different kinds of set-ups for a given listing. So if in doubt, please experiment.
Note: Due to the complexity involved \u0026amp; the associated paths used for the many junctions added for the avenue network, it is strongly recommended that using any vehicles during UDI Mode not be \u0026ldquo;Snapped\u0026rdquo; to the network if attempting to travel through any of these new avenue junctions.

The contents of this document are undergoing revision and are subject to change. While CAN-AM is technically functional without any additional files, it is designed to work with either of the following (which are necessary for the canals to have walls):
CAL SG Canals by callagrafx (recommended) OR The original SG Canals by SimGoober The NAM CAN-AM files do include a single passenger station for use with CAN-AM. Additional passenger stations and even freight stations are available on the LEX at SC4 Devotion. Note that these separate download stations may have dependency lists.
Building CAN-AM Canals # The CAN-AM pieces are located under the Misc. Transit menu.
To build a functional canal with CAN-AM, start by building the outer walls of the canal with your canal set (in this case, the CAL SG Canals). In between the walls, place the CAN-AM pieces, which provide the actual transportation functionality. CAN-AM canals must be at least 3 tiles wide: 2 tiles for the walls on each side, and at least 1 tile for the CAN-AM pieces.
Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Crossings with CAN-AM are currently puzzle piece-based. There are two versions of each crossing piece for the supported network crossings\u0026ndash;one for the wall, and one for the open water. The open water tiles allow for canal traffic to pass underneath.
The crossing can be assembled as follows:
Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Note that CAN-AM is an older feature that has not seen much new development in the past decade. As such, it is reliant on a limited array of semi-deprecated/legacy features, especially in terms of crosslinks with newer/more modern NAM features.
Being that the CAN-AM canals are a mass transit network (technically based on the Bus vehicle type), they need stations in order to allow access. The CAS 1x1 Ferry Terminal (included in the mod) is one option. Place it aligned with a canal wall, with the arrow pointing toward the water in the canal. Note that the stations require Power in order to function.
Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Note that in order for canal boat automata to appear on the canals, one of the \u0026ldquo;magic pieces\u0026rdquo; must be placed as part of the build process, preferrably in the open water next to the station. These include the + and T-intersections, as well as the 90° L-bend. (Thanks to CorinaMarie for this discovery!)
If everything is done properly (at least two stations of the same type are needed for full functionality), traffic should begin to use the canal.
Neighbor Connections with CAN-AM are possible as well. Simply build a standard Road-based Neighbor Connection, and plop the CAN-AM pieces over top of the Road.

Rather than the seven shades of blue in the original, this version uses the full spectrum of color, including approximately 48 distinct color shades. The maximum volume shown for each travel type has been increased from a flat 1200 for all types in the original Traffic Volume View to a value which is 300% of the capacity of the underlying network for the selected travel type. (Since only one commute period is shown at a time, this is one half of the standard network capacity, which is calculated for a full day.) The legend has been increased from five to nine entries, and each color in the legend is followed by the percentage of the underlying network capacity that that color represents, as well as the actual number of Sims represented by that percentage. When a travel type may have more than one underlying network (e.g., cars may travel on streets, roads, or highways), a subtext below the legend indicates which network is being referenced in the display.
The colors in the display have been arranged so that they are more concentrated at lower levels, in order to give finer granularity at lower volumes. Between volumes of 0% and 10%, colors change about every 1.5%. Between 10% and 130%, colors change about ever 5%. And between 130% and 300%, colors change about every 10%. Please note that while every attempt has been made to attain the greatest accuracy possible, all numbers are somewhat approximate. The numbers following each color in the legend refer to the approximate beginning of the range of that particular color.
You may notice that starting at 100%, the colors follow those in the Traffic Congestion View. However, it is important to keep in mind the difference between theTraffic Congestion View and the Traffic Volume View. The Congestion View is compiled from an entire day\u0026rsquo;s travel statistics, while the Volume View refers to only a single commute period. Therefore, yellow in a single volume view does not necessarily indicate congestion, and blue or green in a single volume view does not necessarily indicate lack of congestion. Furthermore, some of the volume views include non-congestion producing travel types, which are pedestrians, buses, and ferries. An experienced player may be able to look at both commute periods of certain volume views and get a good idea of congestion, but it is necessary to be careful here.
The Traffic Volume View also includes a new Subway View. The new Subway View acts in most ways like the normal underground Subway View, which is entered by selecting the Subway Tool when you want to build or demolish subways. However, it has included in it the volume display feature of the Traffic Volume View, which allows you to see the usage of your subways as you are building (or demolishing) them. Like the rest of the Traffic Volume View, this view shows the volume of traffic in each subway line visible in the main map, as well as in all subway lines in the minimap.
The last feature included in the Traffic Volume View is a new Subway Building View, which is entered whenever you select a subway station to build. It differs from the standard Subway Building View in that no buildings other than subway stations are displayed; zones are displayed wherever possible; and like the Subway View, the volume of traffic in each subway line visible in the main map, as well as in all subway lines in the minimap. In addition, zones and transit station locations are shown in the minimap.
Finally, most transit station types light up in all volume views. This does not indicate anything about usage; it is simply so you can identify them easily. Certain types of transit stations do not light up because of the way they were designed.
A new Zones view is also included with the Traffic Volume View. The new Zones view is identical to the Subway Building View, except that subway volume levels are not displayed.

The new method currently supports tunnel portals for four networks in the RealHighway (RHW) plugin: the RHW-2, RHW-3, RHW-4, and the MIS Ramp.
The menu button used to access the Subway-based FLUPs content is located under the Highways menu, and it contains the items listed below:
RHW Flex-FLUPs Button # FLEX FLUPs RHW Portal FLEX FLUPs Road Portal FLEX FLUPs One-Way Road Portal Underground Road-2 (URoad-2) Starter Piece (for use with RHW-2 and Road portals) Underground Road-3 (URoad-3) Starter Piece Underground Ramp (URamp) Starter Piece Underground Road-4 (URoad-4) Starter Piece (for use with RHW-4 and One-Way Road portals) Underground Road-6S (URoad-6S) Starter Piece Street FLEX Overcrossing Road FLEX Overcrossing One-Way Road FLEX Overcrossing Avenue FLEX Overcrossing Street FLEX Overcrossing RHW FLEX Overcrossing Rail FLEX Overcrossing Light Rail FLEX Overcrossing Monorail FLEX Overcrossing Ground Highway FLEX Overcrossing Elevated Highway FLEX Overcrossing To begin constructing a Subway-based FLUPs system, first place the Tunnel Portals at the desired entrance and exit points for your underground route:
To start the underground portion itself (new instructions as of NAM 41), either place down one of the network starter pieces, and drag the Subway network through it (note: it may not be visible until dragging Subway through it), and between the portals, or build the Subway first, place the starter piece on top of it (using the Traffic Data View as a guide), then click in the vicinity with the Subway tool to convert it to the appropriate network.
As the Portal is FLEX-based, it can accept overrides, and be converted to other networks by simply connecting an override network into it. At present, the only accepted override networks, for the RHW portal, the RHW-3, RHW-4, RHW-6S, and MIS Ramp, while the Road and One-Way Road portals presently do not accept overides. To make this conversion, simply place the starter piece of the desired override network somewhere before the start of the Portal, and drag it into the ground end. (Note that this above ground action no longer affects the underground network directly\u0026ndash;this change was made in NAM 41 to improve the stability and reliability of the Subway-based FLUPs system.)
As noted before, the Subway-based override networks can be used to create curving tunnels. The premise for constructing these is the same as with any other override network. Note that the \u0026ldquo;sharp\u0026rdquo; bends to diagonal may break the override. Ensure the bend is at the proper angle to prevent reversion to the base Subway network.
Some minor glitches may appear near the starter pieces of the underground network after doing so; these are unavoidable and do not affect the functionality of the network.
Being that the underground network is Subway-based, it can cross under blank terrain, Zones, Buildings (Zoned or Plopped), and Parks and remain functional, without any issue or additional work. Much like the base Subway network, commuters and freight can \u0026ldquo;shortcut\u0026rdquo; to and from Zones/Buildings to the underground network\u0026ndash;this is an unavoidable part of game behavior. Being fully pathed as a standard Road or Highway-type network underground, all three Transit Types normally associated with those networks\u0026ndash; Cars, Buses, and Freight Trucks\u0026ndash;can use the Subway-based FLUPs. Note, however, that the Subway-based FLUPs cannot cross standard Subways.
While it is physically possible to build other networks over top of the Subway-based FLUPs, doing so will normally block traffic and render the underground network non-functional. This can, however, be circumvented by using the FLEX Overcrossing Pieces (FLEX-OCPs). To build an overcrossing, simply find the FLEX piece for the appropriate network, place it down, and reconnect the network through the gap created by the Construction Tile. To ensure proper placement over top of the underground network, use one of the game\u0026rsquo;s Traffic DataViews, like the Traffic Congestion DataView (pictured) or the Traffic Volume Data View, in order to locate it.
If built properly, a textured red ribbon should appear across the spot where the undercrossing exists when one hovers over it with one of the Query tools. If the underground network is carrying traffic, it should be visible here with the Traffic Query. (Note that the underground network itself will not register traffic on the Traffic Query, due to the game not being set up to report Car/Bus/Freight Truck traffic on the Subway network.)
Given that the overcrossing is FLEX-based, it can convert to match supported override networks for that base network. Below, the Road FLEX Overcrossing Piece was converted to L1 Road Viaduct, simply by hooking the L1 Road Viaduct Starter into it.
The following override networks are supported by each of the following Overcrossing Pieces:
Road: L1 Road Viaduct, L2 Road Viaduct, TLA-3, AVE-2, ARD-3, NRD-4, TLA-5, RD-4, RD-6, TLA-7, AVE-6 One-Way Road (OWR): L1 OWR Viaduct, L2 OWR Viaduct, OWR-1, OWR-3, OWR-4, OWR-5 Avenue: L1 Avenue Viaduct, L2 Avenue Viaduct Rail (RRW): Single-Track Rail (STR) Elevated (Light) Rail/Tram:: Ground Light Rail (GLR\u0026ndash;all styles) RealHighway (RHW): All RHW override networks The following override/FLEX/puzzle networks are NOT supported at present:
Street Addon Mod (SAM) Override Networks High Speed Rail Project (HSRP) Override Networks L1 and L2 Rail (ERRW) Viaducts Hybrid Railway (HRW) Alternate Viaducts GLR/Tram-in-Avenue (TiA) GLR/Tram-in-Road (TiR) GLR/Tram-on-Road (ToR) GLR/Tram-on-Street (ToS) Elevated (Light) Rail (ELR)-over-Road (EoR) Elevated (Light) Rail (ELR)-over-Avenue (EoA) Elevated (Light) Rail (ELR)-over-RD-4 (EoRD-4) Additional Notes # Crossings involving diagonals are also not supported at present. U-Drive-It (UDI) functionality is also unfortunately not possible with the Subway-based override network. The old puzzle pieces do still support UDI. The transit types supported by the FLEX FLUPs portals are Cars, Buses, and Freight Trucks. The portals and the URoad networks do not support Pedestrian/Sim paths, nor any other transit type. The Monorail and Elevated Highway FLEX Overcrossings may produce indestructible shadows. This has proven thus far to be unavoidable and uncorrectable. Much as with the previous puzzle-based FLUPs, which are Road-based, due to how the Traffic Simulator\u0026rsquo;s hardcoded aspects inherit properties for networks using unexpected transit types, the capacity and speed for the Subway-based FLUPs are also identical to that of the Road network. The new FLEX-based FLUPs Portals do support nightlighting. To see the nightlighting on the Portals, ensure they are connected to Power. Both Maxis Nite and Dark Nite options are available. Maxis Nite is installed by default, but Dark Nite may be selected under the \u0026ldquo;7_Texture and Drive Side\u0026rdquo; section of the NAM installer, under each texture/drive-side combination. When bulldozing the new URoad starter pieces, the starter may appear in the above ground view after demolition while in Subway view. To fully remove it, demolish it in the above ground view as well. The Road and One-Way Road portals are designed to hook into the URoad-2 and URoad-4 networks, respectively. There are no separate underground networks for use with these portals, nor are there any plans to add them. Old Method: Puzzle Pieces # This documentation has not yet been written. However, an online tutorial by Chrisim can be found here.

Active development is likely to resume in the future. In the early years of SC4, new technology was found by smoncrie which allowed us to use a single puzzle piece to create a starter for a new set of textures or models for the same network, there are already a few mods that take advantage of this technology, namely draggable GLR, SAM, and RHW. At the moment, there are two new model variations included in this mod, High Speed Rail (HSR, elevated) and Ground High Speed Rail (GHSR).
The original HSRP replaced Monorail. At the time this was the best way of implementation, and was created by 3ddz, founded by Murakamon, on the 24th of February 2006. Since then there has only been one release, HSRP Beta 1. This mod uses the original models from that release for HSR, and a lowered version for GHSR. No other modifications were made to the models.
NOTE: The High Speed Rail Project, in its current form, is no longer in active development. Its planned successor, Real High Speed Rail (RHSR) system is currently in development.
Installing the High Speed Rail Project from the NAM Installer # To install the High Speed Rail Project via Custom Installation, under the 2 Additional Network Features section, under Monorail, select the \u0026ldquo;High Speed Rail Project\u0026rdquo; option. This box is automatically selected by default.
HSR Override Networks # The High Speed Rail Project includes a total of two Monorail-based draggable override networks: the (Elevated) High Speed Rail network (HSR), which consists of an elevated track at a height of 15.5 meters (functionally equivalent to \u0026ldquo;Level 2\u0026rdquo; in NAM elevation nomenclature), and the Ground High Speed Rail network (GHSR), which sits essentially at ground level, at 1 meter elevation.
To build an HSR override network, first place the appropriate starter piece from the menu, then select the Monorail network tool, and drag Monorail through the starter. The stretch of Monorail should convert to the appropriate HSR network at that point.
Curves to diagonals can also be accomplished through simple dragging motions, as with any other draggable network. HSR has been designed to have a slightly wider radius for its default curve, which should be taken into consideration when building over/underpasses near curves.
Supported draggable crossing setups can be built much in the same way that Monorail crossings are, by simply dragging the HSR tracks over (or under) the desired network as appropriate. Due to game limitations, the crossing will initially show as a Monorail crossing in the preview, but provided the setup is supported, it will change to the appropriate HSR override network. HSR networks cannot cross other networks at the same height level, as grade separation is key to allowing the trains to operate at high speeds. Both HSR and GHSR, however, can cross over or under an L1 elevated network, such as the L1 RealHighway shown below.
If a crossing reverts back to the base Monorail network, or results in a \u0026ldquo;blank spot\u0026rdquo; in the network, it is a sign that the particular setup is not supported by the plugin. Refer to the Network Capabilities section of this document for guidance. Note that some setups not possible through draggable means can be constructed through the use of static puzzle pieces (see List of Menu Items below).
Capacities and Speeds # The capacity and speed of both the Elevated and Ground High Speed Rail override networks is identical to that of the base Monorail network. The precise capacity depends on the Traffic Plugin one has installed. Capacity is generally calculated on a per tile basis by the game.
Capacities Network Classic Low Medium High Ultra All HSR Networks 5000 10000 16000 30000 65200 Speeds Network Speed HSR Train 225 A Note Regarding Automata # As the High Speed Rail Project\u0026rsquo;s override networks are Monorail-based, Monorail automata will appear on HSR tracks by default. If one wishes to change the appearance of the HSR trains, are several third-party HSRP automata skins available (which probably look nice on your Monorail tracks as well). One such set is the VDK Train Mods Vol 7 package by NAM Team member vester.
Bridges # The High Speed Rail Project supports several different types of bridges, for both the elevated HSR network and GHSR. To build the bridges, simply drag the Monorail network across the body of water (or sufficiently deep canyon), and options for HSR bridges will appear.
HSR Bridges # Cable-Stayed HSR Bridge HSR Bridge Bailey Truss HSR Bridge Concrete HSR Bridge High Speed Rail Suspension Bridge GHSR Bridges # GHSR Bridge Concrete GHSR Bridge Warren Thru-Truss GHSR Bridge Box Girder GHSR Bridge Cable-Stayed GHSR Bridge Tunnels # Being based on the Monorail network, HSR and GHSR do NOT support the construction of properly functioning tunnels. However, one can convert to the Subway network from HSR by using third-party lots, such as the HSRP Subway Converters by ebina and 3ddz.
Stations # The NAM includes several stations for the HSR family of override networks, all of are Transit-Enabled Lots. In order to enable network passage through the network, simply drag the Monorail network through the station in the appropriate direction. All of these stations can be found under the Rails Menu.

Specifications of the HRW include catenaries, textures that are the same as the RRW, as well as including some purpose-built textures for specific pieces.
In terms of functionality, the HRW handles both Heavy Rail (in orange) and Monorail as shown (in dark blue) below.
The HRW is a FLEX network utilising dual-networking (Rail and Monorail) pieces meaning it can only be constructed with FLEX pieces provided in the menus. To gain full functionality, all items require placing FLEX pieces, with drawability only relevant for transitioning to the RRW.
Menu Icons # The HybridRailway menu icons are grouped together above the RealRailway and all of the HybridRailway content can be accessed from these buttons. The icons are courtesy of RVT or Rivit.
Straight PiecesContains straight segments in both Orthogonal and Diagonal of various lengths. Elevated Pieces [L1]Elevated starters including a L1 Flex Height Transition, Orthogonal and Diagonal FLEX onslope transitions. Multi-Radius CurvesIncludes curves from R1 to R5. Smaller curves are wider than their RRW counterparts Switches for the Hybrid RailwaySwitches for the HRW that include A2 types, B2 Types, Compounds and the FA-2 FLEX Switch pieces. Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) # There are 5 Radii of Multi-Radius curves that are similar to the RRW specified curves. Notably, the first three curves have a wider geometry than the equivalent RRW Multi-Radius curves. These are the R1-Macro curve, and the R2 and R3 alternative curves.
Multi-Radius Curves for the Hybrid Railway # Radius #1 Macro Alternative Curve Radius #2 Macro Alternative Curve Radius #3 Macro Alternative Curve The above curves have a wider geometry than the corresponding curves for the Real Railway.
For reference, \u0026ldquo;alternative\u0026rdquo; notation refers to wider or bigger radii, and \u0026ldquo;short\u0026rdquo; refers to smaller radii than the standard Multi-Radius or Fractional Angle Curve.
Radius #4 Curve Radius #5 Curve Hybrid Railway FLEX Switches # There are a few switch options for the Hybrid Railway system that consist of a few FLEX-piece items that can be used to make a variety of layout combinations. Apart from the FA-2 short FLEX Switch piece, these are partially static due to the mechanics of the codebase.

FA-2 Short FLEX Switch Piece # The HRW also has a piece that can be made by placing down straight orthogonal segments to make a variety of switches for the Hybrid Railway. The piece is in the switches tab loop and can be used for fractional angle straight segments, bends, and switches.
FA-2 short Flex-Switch piece The switches are made by adding in segments of straight to the FA2-s piece. Straight pieces can be compounded to make a longer straight section. This piece has limited slope tolerance. Below are the patterns for making various switches.
These are just some of the combinations for the HRW FLEX-switch Piece A few possibilities with the FLEX-switch piece Hybrid Railway Elevated Content # The Hybrid Railway has orthogonal and diagonal L1 sections or sections elevated to 7.5m. Only straight pieces can be elevated. Curves and swiches will remain at Ground level.
Diagonal overpass over the RHW6S Stub-to-Stub (STS) Crossing Construction Method # The Hybrid Railway currently supports L1 or 7.5m elevation for straight pieces (orthogonal and diagonal), as well as crossings that are initated with the stub to stub (STS) method of crossings.
The STS method is very important for the construction of crosssings for the Hybrid Railway. Since the Hybrid Railway is a multi-network override in itself, the HRW crossings neet to use the Stub to Stub or STS method of making a crossing. A demonstration is below.
A diagram demonstrating the stub to stub method Crossing Support # The Hybrid Railway supports a large amount of, but not all, crossings in the Network Addon Mod (NAM). Orthogonal crossing orthogonal has significant coverage in addition to other configurations. However, with the exception of HRW X HRW configurations, all crossings require the stub to stub method to complete them.
In the interests of keeping this document to a reasonable length, refer to this section of the Hybrid Railway technical document to see what crossings are supported.
Stations for the Hybrid Railway # In addition, the HRW has a number of station options capable of utilizing both heavy rail and monorail/HSR traffic.
These stations have been created by Tyberius06 and ulisse99.
An example of various stations that were created to accompany the Hybrid Railway Mod. These stations are highlighted by the icons shown on the left. In most situations, the monorail tool will need to be drawn through the station to make a successful connection to the Hybrid Railway. For the Station to function correctly with both Heavy Rail and High Speed/Monorail traffic, the station needs to use monorail. If only Heavy Rail is used, the station will only accept Heavy Rail traffic.
Connecting a station to the Hybrid Railway The HRW network can support both Heavy Rail and High Speed/Monorail Traffic. Existing stations in a given city can be used with the Hybrid Railway, however will only support Heavy Rail.
Tips and Tricks # There is one way to make or convert segments of the RRW to the HRW specification by following the below instructions. Note that this method only works with straight orthogonal or diagonal sections of the Real Railway.
Draw out an Orthogonal or Diagonal segment of Railway. Click on each Rail section with the Monorail tool. After progressively clicking the RRW will be converted to the HRW as shown by the overhead wires and poles. Additionally, the height of the HRW L1 is the same as the L1 ERRW. Unfortunately the RRW flex On-Slope Transition is NOT compatible with the monorail network, however, an onslope piece can be used from the Elevated HRW menu instead.
With straight sections of L1 RRW, click on each tile with the Monorail network. An override is needed to make this function.

Active development is likely to resume in the future. The NAM\u0026rsquo;s feature additions to this area of the transportation system include numerous Dual-Networking options, allowing for Light Rail and Tram service to be placed in the median of, or over top of, various surface street networks, including Roads, Avenues, and Streets.
Installing the Light Rail/Tram Features from the NAM Installer # The various Light Rail/Tram features in the NAM are found in the NAM Installer under \u0026ldquo;2 Additional Network Features \u0026gt; Light Rail\u0026rdquo;. The modules listed under this section are described in more detail in the Networks section below.
Light Rail/Tram Override Networks, Pseudo-Networks, and Dual-Networking Options # Overview # The Light Rail/Tram portion of the NAM features several draggable and semi-draggable override networks, along with (still) puzzle piece-based pseudo-networks, allowing for a variety of configurations beyond the game\u0026rsquo;s standard Elevated (Light) Rail network, which operates at 15.5-meter height (a small fraction above the NAM\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Level 2\u0026rdquo; (L2, 15 meters) standard).
Ground Light Rail/Tram # One of the trademark features of the entire NAM is the Ground Light Rail (GLR)/Tram system, which offers a ground-level counterpart to the Elevated (Light) Rail network. Four different types of GLR tracks are presently available as draggable override networks: the standard Ground Light Rail, Rural Ground Light Rail, and the two customizable Extended Ground Light Rail sets (which are installed as part of the Ground Light Rail Extension option).
All of these override networks can either be constructed by first placing a Starter Piece, then dragging the appropriate default network through the starter, at which point the draggable network should convert to match the starter. This process is shown below on the standard Ground Light Rail network.
Making crossings with other networks (save for with Elevated Light Rail itself\u0026ndash;which presently requires a puzzle piece) is just a simple matter of dragging Ground Light Rail across the crossing network.
Ground Light Rail junctions can be built by simply dragging Elevated Light Rail to, from, or through a Ground Light Rail line.
Should you prefer to start off your line with a proper terminus, there are special starters featuring loops at the end for line starts and ends. Transitions to Elevated Light Rail with a GLR starter on the end are also available:
The two optional Extended Ground Light Rail sets (selectable in the NAM installer) have fewer supported crossings and capabilities at present, but the base texture underneath the tracks can be easily swapped for a custom one of your choosing, simply by importing a texture of the Transit Group ID (0x1abe787d) and the appropriate Instance ID for each set: 0x5f888100-04 for Extended GLR Set 1 (default is grass), 0x5f88c100-04 for Extended GLR Set 2 (default is red brick).
In addition to Draggable GLR, the older Legacy GLR Puzzle Pieces remain available. It is highly recommended for users to utilize the Draggable GLR instead of the old puzzle pieces, not only for ease of construction, but because of the prospect of the TE Lot/Puzzle Piece Crash-To-Desktop issues when building stations. While this longstanding threat has been effectively solved for Windows users with simmaster07\u0026rsquo;s SC4Fix.dll patch, with the 64-bit version of the Aspyr macOS port disabling the use of SC4MacInjector (which allowed SC4Fix.dll and other DLL-based mods to operate on macOS), the threat still exists on the Mac platform.
The most reliable method for building stations is to plop the Ground Light Rail station in between sections of Ground Light Rail, or not-yet-overridden Elevated Light Rail, and drag the Elevated Light Rail tool through the station to activate its pathing.
Bridges for Ground Light Rail are also possible. Drag the Elevated Light Rail tool orthogonally across a body of water, select the appropriate bridge (noting some components may initially still look like Elevated Light Rail in the construction process), and then release. The override cannot carry through a bridge, so one will need to place a Ground Light Rail starter on the other side of the bridge to initiate the overrides over there.
Tram-in-Network Dual-Networking Options # The NAM includes a number of options to run Light Rail/Tram lines both within the medians of, and directly on various road-type networks. There are presently four different Tram Dual-Networking options available:
Tram-in-Avenue (TiA) Tram-in-Road (TiR) Tram-on-Road (ToR) (perhaps more accurately, Tram-on-NRD-4) Tram-on-Street (ToS) All four may be constructed via puzzle pieces, and three of the four\u0026ndash;all but Tram-on Road (ToR)\u0026ndash;may be at least partially constructed through semi-draggable means, by clicking over the individual tiles of the respective base road-type network (Avenue, Road, or Street) with the Elevated (Light) Rail network tool. (Note that the semi-draggable method is the only way to construct certain crossings, including RHW and Road Viaduct crossings.) Diagonal versions of the dual networks require puzzle pieces.
Tram Dual-Networking Semi-Draggable Construction # Tram-in-Avenue Tram-in-Road Tram-on-Street To build intersections with the Semi-Draggable Tram Dual Networks, simply drag the network up to the edge of the dual network, ending in a stub just before it. This will form a T-intersection (if ground level) or the start of an overcrossing (if elevated). To complete a full 4-way +-intersection (or a full network overcrossing), simply follow the same process on the opposite side. If you are seeking to build an intersection between two Tram Dual Networks, simply convert the crossing base single network to a dual network by using the Elevated (Light) Rail overplop method on it. It will convert to an intersection between two dual networks. Note that some additional overclick with the Elevated (Light) Rail tool may be required to fully convert the intersection. Not all crossings and setups are supported yet with the semi-draggable method, in which cases it may become necessary to use the older puzzle pieces.
Zone access can also be somewhat complicated with the Tram Dual Networks as well. It is recommended to build the base network without the Tram function first, zone, and then add the Dual Network. To allow passengers to board and depart trams/trains, use one of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s included Tram/GLR Dual-Networking stations. To activate pathing, drag two stretches of One-Way Road for the Tram-in-Avenue, use Road for Tram-in/on-Road, and Street for Tram-on-Street.
Light Rail-over-Network Dual-Networking Options # In addition to the surface running of Light Rail/Tram lines within and directly on road-type networks, some support is available to run them on viaducts directly overhead of networks:
Elevated Light Rail-over-Road Elevated Light Rail-over-Street Elevated Light Rail-over-Avenue Elevated Light Rail-over-RD-4 (4-lane Road, from the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Network Widening Mod (NWM) Plugin) Elevated Light Rail-over-PedMall The Over-Road, Over-Street, and Over-PedMall options currently exist as puzzle pieces, and can be found under the Elevated Light Rail-over-Road button. Crossings are built using puzzle pieces, such as the ones below:
The Over-Avenue and Over-RD-4 options, however, exist primarily as FLEX Pieces, with some transitions being puzzle piece-based. Supported intersections between other networks and Elevated Light Rail-over-Avenue and RD-4 can be made simply by dragging those networks through the Over-Avenue/RD-4 FLEX Pieces:
High Elevated (Light) Rail Pseudo-Network (Puzzle Piece-Based) LEGACY # In addition to support for Light Rail/Tram at the ground level, there is limited \u0026ldquo;legacy\u0026rdquo; support for High Elevated (Light) Rail (30.5-meter height, a fraction above the NAM\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Level 4\u0026rdquo; (L4, 30 meters) standard), via puzzle pieces. This system is limited, but does provide an additional height level (note that full draggable support for another height level of Elevated (Light) Rail has been discussed for a future NAM release, though which height is yet to be determined, and there is no timeline for when this addition may occur).
A Note Regarding Neighbor Connections # Neighbor Connections are possible for all of the items listed here. Simply build the draggable, semi-draggable, or puzzle-based component at the edge of both city tiles, using the base network (Elevated Light Rail for base Ground Light Rail and High Elevated Rail, the appropriate road-type network for Tram and Elevated Rail Dual Networks).
Known Issues # There may be some issues with Fire Engine access on Tram and Elevated Light Rail Dual Networks, if a fire is on the opposite side of the tracks from the Fire Engine.

This documentation was last updated with NAM 35. It is in the process of being rewritten. Preface # Overview # The Maxis Highway Override (abbreviated MHO ), sometimes called Project Symphony (abbreviated PS), is an attempt to join the Maxis Highways (abbreviated as MHW) with the Real Highway Mod (RHW) by the total conversion of the MHW. The new MHW will have the specifications of the RHW. It looks like an RHW, rides like an RHW but is built like an MHW.
For new users unfamiliar with the RHW, the MHO can be a first step at getting familiar with the RHW paradigm. However, for experienced users who know their way around RHW, this can be a very powerful supplement to existing RHW systems.
NOTE: When reading this document, there may be key terms to take note of or terms that are used differently than normal. This includes the following terms:
Bridge and Overpass : In the field of transit modding, bridges over other networks and bridges over water and ravines are two completely different things. A bridge that goes over another network is an overpass. A bridge that goes over water is what is considered a bridge. Overpasses and elevated networks have a fixed height, and have to be placed using starters, whereas bridges have to be selected through the bridge selection window, and have a variable height throughout the entire length. Carriageway : This may be used as a synonym for a single one-way RHW. Diagonal : This refers to being at a 45-degree angle to the SimCity 4 grid. Highway : This term will be used universally to refer to freeway, expressway, interstate, divided highway, and dual carriageway. LHD and RHD : Left-hand drive and right-hand drive instead refer to which side of the road you drive on, not which side of the car you drive in. Orthogonal : This is a synonym for “ perpendicular ” in certain mathematical fields, but in the field of Transit Network Modding, it instead refers to being in line, or parallel, with the SimCity 4 grid. Perpendicular is used instead for networks crossing at 90-degree angles. Compatibility # The NAM and its plugins are only compatible with SimCity 4 \u0026ldquo;Rush Hour\u0026rdquo; or SimCity 4 Deluxe , Version 1.1.638 or higher. It is required that you install the SimCity 4 EP1 Update 1 Patch (for Version 1.1.638) before proceeding with installation. If you have purchased SimCity 4 Deluxe from Steam or another digital retailer, the Version number will be 1.1.641, and should be pre- patched.
Attempting to use this mod with other versions of SimCity 4 will cause the game to instantly crash upon loading.
Disclaimer # The usage of this download is on your own risk. We try to test our products extensively, so they should work properly, but errors may still exist. Feel free to modify the items for yourself and show them in your city journals, but please don\u0026rsquo;t distribute them without asking first.
Installation and Setup # IMPORTANT!!! IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO CREATE A BACKUP OF YOUR CITIES AND YOUR PLUGINS FOLDER IN THE EVENT THAT SOMETHING GOES WRONG. IF SOMETHING DOES GO WRONG, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO RESTORE YOUR PREVIOUS FILES.
In order to install the Maxis Highway Override Mod using the NAM Installer , you need to select the option for it. If you decide to install this at a later time, simply run the installer again.
NOTE: Since the RHW is required to use this plugin, the RHW will also be automatically selected.
If you are using a Left-Hand Drive installation (cars driving on the left), be sure to select the LHD Plugin.

In this era, the NAM Team created various MHW interchange pieces, such as the MHW Stack, the OxD MHW Interchange, and various three-way interchanges. However, this was always a time-consuming task, due to the MHWs being hard to modify and their under-scaled dimensions, and progressively fewer MHW items were made.
With the advent of RHW Version 3.0, it was now possible to create RHW interchanges solely using RHW. With the RHW’s increasing popularity, more and more modding effort was devoted towards RHW, eventually leaving out MHW out of the interest of modders. However, even before RHW began to overtake MHW, there have been attempts at converting the MHW to a more realistic setup, the most notable at the time was Shadow Assassin’s Urban Highway Mod , but this mod was never released.
During recent years and during P57’s development, the idea was revitalised and experimented with by many NAM Team Members, such as Tarkus (Alex) and GDO29Anagram (Ganaram). These ideas were later picked up by jdenm8 and MandelSoft , and expanded upon with the addition of RHW-styled Ramp Interfaces, and eventually, semi-prefab interchanges. The NAM 31 includes the first public release of this mod.

Functionality, Networks, and Networks Types # Because this is a mod that overrides an existing network, Project Symphony networks are identical in function to the original Maxis Highways, as much of the original function is retained. The following networks are included.
Ground-Level Highways # The Ground Level Maxis Highway , or Height Level 0 Maxis Highway (abbreviated as L MHW ) is a fully draggable two-tile network. Both halves of the highway are dragged at the same time.
Project Symphony completely overrides the narrow 2x3 lane Maxis Highway with a wide 2x2 lane RHW-like highway. This means that all your existing Maxis Highways will be replaced by the MHO design. In other words, this is not a starter-override network, but rather, a complete revamp of the base network.
The network has barriers all the way; it has a single centre barrier and two outer barriers, making them distinctive from the RHW.
Shown left to right: Project Symphony MHW and Dual RHW-4.
The L0 MHW can’t cross any network at-grade. You need to transition into another network first, like AVE-4 or RHW-4. This is because it’s a limited access network and slow traffic is banned here.
Elevated Highways # The Elevated Highway , or Height Level 2 Maxis Highway (abbreviated as L2 MHW ) is a fully draggable two-tile network. Like its L0-counterpart, this is also a complete override, but only 15 meters higher than its ground level counterpart. It may look a lot like a Dual RHW-4; the only difference is that it only has a single centre barrier instead of a double one.
Shown left to right: MHO MHW (L2) and Dual RHW-4 (L2). Note the difference between the pillars and the barriers.
MIS Network # The MIS Ramp , also called MIS Network or just MIS , is a network designed for interchanging traffic between any two RHW networks, or between an RHW network and a non-RHW network. It’s the backbone for designing custom interchanges.
Because of its importance with interchanging traffic, this network can create at-grade crossings with almost every other network.
The Maxis Highway Override uses this network from the RHW, since it would be useless to create two networks with the same function. Therefore, the RHW is a necessary dependency for this mod to work properly. Just with the MHWs, MIS also has a ground-level and elevated version, though the MIS has four elevated counterparts.
NOTE: If you installed the NAM using the NAM Installer, the RHW should be automatically installed when you installed Project Symphony.
Tunnels and Bridges # Tunnels # The tunnels for MHW have been repurposed and remodeled to be compatible for the newly- designed MHWs. This requires a custom slope mod, which is also included.
Bridges # The MHO includes two bridges: an L0 Level Bridge and an L2 Level Bridge. The bridges made for Dual RHW-4 can also be used. Due to the slight height differences between Ground MHO Highways and RHW-4, a bridge transition is included to properly transition between the two
Networks # For additional options, it is also possible to use AVE-4 bridges, though these bridges will have a lower capacity.
Puzzle-based Items # Puzzle-based items are static items that can be used for different purposes. These items can be found under the Highways Menu. In order to navigate through the different types of pieces, you must press the TAB key, and to go back, press SHIFT+TAB. To rotate a selected puzzle piece, press the Home and End keys. A comprehensive list of what items are included can be found in
The current Maxis Highway Override contains the following Puzzle-based items:
Ramp Interfaces # Just like the RHW, the Maxis Highway Override has the ability to create custom interchanges. Since making prefabs takes a lot of work and are incredibly inflexible, and that real-life interchanges can be incredibly massive (exceeding the 16x16 tile maximum for puzzle pieces), there instead exists a set of ramp interfaces designed to complement the MIS network.
The MHO borrows many components of the RHW’s Modular Interchange System , a set of interchange pieces which can be assembled in an infinite number of combinations to create any type of interchange. The MHO also adds in its own pieces, but compared to RHW, the selection of features it adds in itself is fairly limited.
These pieces are found under the Ramps Button , located under the buttons from the base networks of the mod.
Curves # Wide Radius Curves allow for a smoother and more realistic turn-radius, enhancing the look and feel of curving networks. These pieces are found under the Curves Button.
This button also contains the Fractional Angled MHW (FAMHW). These pieces are neither orthogonal nor diagonal. These can be used for extremely gentle curves and for going against the orthogonal-diagonal grid in general.
Transitions # Transitions allow you to switch between two different heights of MHW or between different networks. There are two types of height Transitions: Ramp Transitions , which switch between two height levels of MHW, and OnSlope Transitions , which are Height Transitions that have to be placed on slopes. These pieces are found under the Transitions Button.
Prefabs and Semi-Prefabs # Prefabs are pre-made interchanges. These interchanges are very static, but also very easy to build. The original MHW had a lot of those interchanges, but the MHO only offers a very limited amount of them.
There are two kinds of prefabs: Total Prefabs , which are complete interchanges with connections and everything, and Semi-Prefabs , which only contain a part of the interchange and require ramps to be connected later on. Semi-prefabs are a little harder to build, but they are also more flexible than total prefabs.
Tips, Tricks, and Tutorials # Starting off with Project Symphony # As quoted directly from the original SimCity 4 Deluxe User’s Manual , “Highways are very expensive compared to [other networks], and tend to take up a lot of space, but their capacity [and] speed limits are [very] high.” This is still true in Project Symphony.
In fact, most of the traditional crossings with both ground and elevated highways have been modified and are still available, as with the original “humpback” overpasses with Road and Rail. Roads and other networks can still cross under Elevated Highways, and Elevated Rail and Monorail can still cross over Ground Highways. Additionally, other networks added by the NAM (HSR, NWM, RHW) will still cross with these networks.
As these networks are base networks and are “natural” to begin with, both MHW and EMHW will still create neighbour connections as before, and the need of neighbour connection pieces is not necessary.
However, for cities that already have the original Highway Interchanges or the NAM’s Custom Interchanges, none of these interchanges will fit with the revamped highways. Because of the large scaling differences between the original interchanges and the revamped highways, it was decided by the NAM Team that none of these interchanges will be modified.
All original MHW interchanges are incompatible with the Maxis Highway Override and it is recommended to bulldoze and replace them if you have these in your cities. Also, all of the original MHW Interchange menu buttons are disabled; however, several interchanges can still be accessed using Autoplace. Refrain from using these interchanges; they may still work, but they will be visually incompatible with the MHO.
Understanding Ramp Interfaces # Unlike the RHW, there are only four types of Ramp Interfaces available: A1, B1, D1, and E1, each diagrammed below from left to right.
Types A1 and B1 (shown left) branch one lane outwards while retaining the two original lanes of the highway. The branch connects with MIS. Types D1 and E1 split the highway into two MIS.
Types A1 and D1 have a parallel branch, while Types B1 and E1 have a branch at a 45-degree angle.
Using Dual RHW-4 Bridges with the Maxis Highway Override # Bridges made for RHW-4 can be used with the MHO. When you build a Dual RHW-4 bridge for a stretch of MHW, you’ll see a subtle height shift:
This is because the MHW is raised 0.75m at ground level. Therefore, under the Transition Menu, a Bridge Transition piece is included. Hover this piece over the stretch of MHW and plop it over the network with the lower end facing the bridge. This will result in a much more gentle transition:
Using RHW with the Maxis Highway Override # The Maxis Highway Override is also designed to work with the RHW. You can simply drag the MHW over or under stretches of RHW without any problems. Moreover, you can transition the MHW into a RHW-4. Both MHWs can transition to their respective RHW-4 counterparts with no issues.
You can also use MHO interchanges for the RHW and vice versa; they will seamlessly transit into each other. For example, the Roundabout Interchange made for the MHO can be made to interface RHW-6S:
Additionally, the MHWs can also be drawn in conjunction with RHW to create a hybrid Multi-RHW.
Interchange Construction # The Maxis Highway Override includes pieces to construct a few types of interchanges. This requires the use of the RHW’s Modular Interchange System. These interchanges are not limited to only the MHO.
The tutorials shown here rely on both MHO and RHW. More advanced tutorials and other interchange designs can be found on the RHW Interchange Guide. The rest is limited to your imagination.
PROTIP: Most interchanges require starting construction at the inside and gradually building out from the centre. This has everything to do with the line-up of all stretches. Keep that in mind as a strategy when you try to build a custom designed interchange.
Diamond interchange # Diamond Interchanges are very simple in design and involve a highway with an arterial road going over or under it. The offramps and onramps create a diamond-like shape with the arterial road, hence the name.
Drag a stretch of L0 MHW. Drag out Road perpendicular to the RHW, starting four tiles away. Do this for both sides of the highway.
Place the Road over MHW Piece (found in the Roads Menu ) on top of the MHW, in the place as shown. This is where the Road will go over the MHW.
Place the Road-MIS Intersection next to the Road over MHW Pieces as shown. Rotate these pieces accordingly. The markings may be very subtle to notice. This is where the MIS will cross with the Road. Do this for both sides of the interchange.
Place the Road Start/End Piece so that it joins with the Road-MIS intersection and the Road. This will connect the overpass with the ground. If the Road on the ground is too close that it gets in the way with placing the Start/End Piece, bulldoze it until it’s at least three tiles from the Road-MIS intersection.
Place an L0-L2 MIS Starterless Height Transition connecting to the Road-MIS crossing. This is found the RHW Transitions Button. This will join the Ramp Interface with the Road. Make sure that the Transition is the correct one, as indicated by the arrows and the word “ON” or “OFF” in the name of the piece. Do this for each of the quadrants.
Place the Type A1 Ramps at the MHW to connect the transitions with the MHW. Do this for each of the quadrants. The completed interchange is quite larger compared to the original Diamond Interchange, but is still very compact.
Roundabout Interchanges # Roundabout Interchanges rely on a Roundabout to interchange traffic. This is a space-saving alternative to building other types of interchanges, with the downside that it isn’t very high- capacity. Constructing both the two-level and three-level Roundabout are similar to each other.
Two-level and Three-level Roundabout Interchanges # Drag one long stretch of Ground Highway (L0) and two small stretches of Elevated Highway (L2) perpendicular to the Ground Highway and two tiles away. Make sure that you don’t drag the elevated highway straight across; this will prevent the autoplace message for the MHW Stack Interchange to appear. If you do drag the elevated highway straight across and you get the message, simply cancel the message.
Select from the Prefabs Menu the L0xL2 Three-Level Roundabout Interchange and plop it directly in the middle. This is the core of the entire interchange. If you are using the L0xL2 Two-Level Roundabout , you will notice that the Roundabout is at L2, and that the highway directly connects to the Roundabout.
Plop the L0-L1 and L1-L2 MIS Transitions (Found in the Maxis Highway Override Transitions Button), or L0-L2 MIS Starterless Height Transitions for the Two-Level Roundabout (Found in the RHW Transitions Button), at the open ramp ends. This will bring interchanging traffic to and from the highways to the roundabout. You will need eight transitions in total for the Three-Level Roundabout, or four transitions for the Two-Level Roundabout. Keep an eye on the direction of the transitions! Also follow the name of the transitions!
Finally, plop the Type A1 Ramps at the ends of the height transitions to complete this interchange. Eight ramps are needed in total for the Three-Level Roundabout, and four ramps are needed for the Two-Level Roundabout. Afterwards, extend out your highways if needed. The closest analogue to the Roundabout Interchange is the MHW Stack Interchange , in terms of how much space one takes compared to the other.
A Note about the Two-Level Roundabout # The Two-level Roundabout was more designed for connecting a highway (L0 MHW) and an arterial network (Avenue), rather than connecting two highways together. The upper connections can be connected to an MHW Ground to Elevated Transition and then transitioned back to Avenue at ground-level, or the connection can be made directly to Elevated Avenue using the Elevated Avenue to Elevated Highway Transition.
T-Stack Interchanges # The Maxis Highway Override includes only one type of Prefab Interchange: The T-Stack Interchange. Due to a design decision regarding how to implement this type of interchange, this will be the only prefab interchange to be added in the NAM.
This piece is found under the Prefabs Button. Pressing Home and End will rotate between the different height combinations. Drag out the corresponding Highway network out of the stubs after placing.
Alternatively, the T-Stack piece can be placed on top of an already-drawn Highway network. If these networks are already drawn in a T, be sure that the two networks don’t connect. Doing so may trigger building the original MHW T-Stack Interchange. The height levels between the two highways don’t matter, since the proper interchange will always be assigned.
Cloverleaf Interchanges # Cloverleaf Interchanges are one of the first interchange designs used to interchange traffic between two highways. This requires giant loops to interchange left-turning traffic (or right- turning traffic in LHD), with the resulting shape of the interchange bearing semblance to a four- leaf clover, hence the name
Full Cloverleaf Interchange # Drag your L0 MHW stretch first. Drag a small stretch of L2 MHW over it so that it crosses perpendicularly with the L0 MHW. The ground highway needs to be fairly long, and the elevated highway needs to be about 12 or 14 tiles long. This is to prevent triggering the autoplace window for the original MHW Stack Interchange.
Plop the Type A1 ramps at the centre first. Keep one tile between the overpass and the ramp end. Eight ramps are needed in total, four for the elevated highway and four more for the ground highway.
Plop the Cloverleaf Ramps to connect the ends of the ramps. This piece is found under the Curves Button. The cursor for these pieces is positioned at the end of the ramp pieces. This will create the turn loops. Do this for all four quadrants.
Place down a Ground to Elevated Highway Transition at the ends of the Elevated Highway. This will transition down the Elevated Highway back to the ground. Do this for both ends of the Interchange. Drag out a stretch of Ground Highway out from the stubs.
Drag a diagonal stretch of RHW right next to the cloverleaf ramps. This will create the shape of the right-turn ramps (or left-turn in LHD).
Place down a MIS Starter at one end of the diagonal RHW. Be sure that the yellow line* is on the inside. Bulldoze the construction handle and connect the starter to the diagonal RHW using the RHW Tool.
Click outwards from the starter to convert the RHW into MIS. Demolish the orthogonal starters afterwards.
Place down Type B1 Ramps to connect the diagonal MIS to the highway. Use the RHW Tool to connect the MIS to the Ramps.
Repeat steps 5 to 8 for the remaining ramps to complete the interchange. The final interchange, shown below, is far larger than the original Cloverleaf Interchange. However, the immense size actually brings the MHO Cloverleaf within reasonable real-life scaling.
*NOTE: if you use the Euro Textures, there will be no yellow lines; all lines are white in the Euro textured version. In that case, keep an eye on the shoulder lanes or direction arrows at starters. When you use Right Hand Drive (RHD) , make the loop around the cloverleaf interchange is counter-clockwise. With Left Hand Drive (LHD) , this should be clockwise.
Half Cloverleaf Interchange # The Half Cloverleaf is a variant of the Full Cloverleaf that acts as a three-way junction. It is essentially half of a cloverleaf; only two of the loops and two of the right-turn ramps are present. Additionally, the interchange itself can be upgraded into a Full Cloverleaf if needed.
Drag one single stretch of Ground Highway. This will create the upper “bar” of the interchange.
Place down two Type A1 Ramps. Make sure that they are four tiles from each other.
Drag two four-tile stretches of RHW so that they both bisect the Ground Highway. Make sure these are two tiles apart. This will become the MIS overpasses.
Place an L2 MIS starter on the two RHW “stubs”. This will override the RHW into the needed overpass. Be sure to keep the yellow lines* on the inside. After which, bulldoze the construction lots on the starters and extend each MIS out by four tiles in each direction.
Place two Cloverleaf Ramps as shown. This will connect the overpasses with the ramps.
Place down two L0-L2 MIS Starterless Height Transitions. This will bring the overpasses to the ground.
Place down two MIS S-curves.
Place down two Type E1 Ramps. Make sure they connect with the MIS curves. Follow steps 5 through 8 for the Full Cloverleaf to connect the Type E1 Ramps with the other highway to complete the rest of the interchange.

Frequently Asked Questions # Questions Regarding Compatibility with Pre-existing MHWs # Can this mod work side-by-side with the original MHWs? # No. This mod is a complete replacement. However, this is an optional NAM component, so you can choose whether to install it or not.
Do I need to demolish any pre-existing MHWs? # Most of the draggable content will be ported over with no problems. Especially there will be quite a lot of diagonal functionality from the first release, something uncommon with other NAM items. However, you probably need to demolish the interchanges, since those are not converted due to lots of modeling work and vast under-scaling. However, you will be able to build other kinds of interchanges as a replacement with some help of the RHW.
Questions Regarding Functionality and General Features # Why is the RHW installed along with the MHO? # Unlike other override mods in the past, the Maxis Highway Override is the only override mod that features puzzle pieces. Since these pieces rely on parts of the RHW, the RHW will be automatically installed along with the MHO.
Can this be used to draw RHWs? # Technically, no. Since the MHO overrides existing networks, rather than using a starter, RHWs can’t be drawn using the MHO.
Why aren’t there any starters on the Ramp Interfaces? # This will allow you to build more compact interchanges. Starters tend to get in the way in that they take up one extra tile of space, particularly on uneven terrain. There will be stubs however. You can use the starters from the RHW for the ramp construction.
Will there be any prefab interchanges? # No. The massive amount of time required in making one, the size limits imposed on them, the fact that they would duplicate already existing functionality, along with the rigid inflexibility of such setups, the underscaled dimensions of these interchanges and the massive number that would have to be made in order to account for all the networks both MHW and RHW renders the notion of plop interchanges impractical and unworkable. Semi-prefabs will probably the biggest components that will be realised.
The only exception is the T-Interchange.
What about the original interchanges? Won’t those be changed? # No. The original interchanges are too small to work with, and therefore will not be converted.
When I was reading through the documentation, I noticed that this included its own slope mod. I’m using a different slope mod. How do I make the MHO/PS Slope Mod work with the other one I have? # In order to make any other slope mod to work friendly with the Maxis Highway Override, the only value that should be changed is the Ground Highway Placement Tuning Parameters Exemplar file (TGI: 0x6534284A, 0x084344E0, 0x0BE08C87). You only need to set the TunnelModelHeights parameter to “9.25, 9.25”, though setting the MinTerrainSlopeForTunnelStart to 10 is recommended. These values have to be modified using Ilive’s Reader.
Questions Regarding Tunnels and Bridges # Are there tunnels and bridges? # The current Maxis Highway bridges have generally proven very difficult to convert. Only the Level Bridges have received the MHO treatment. For addition bridge styles, you will have to use Avenue Bridges instead, or some of the new dual RHW-4 Bridges. For the tunnels, there will be a 7.5m high ground level tunnel override available, which will require a custom slope mod (included in the mod).
What’s the issue with bridges? # In short, the models for the original MHW bridge are hard to convert to MHO due to the differences in S3D settings and scaling. It isn’t as easy as slipping a small plane that has the RHW texture on it.
What about tunnels for other RHW networks? Is there a way to make it work? # There’s no easy solution for “hijacking” the MHW tunnels and repurposing them such that they bear the tunnel entrance and paths of an RHW network other than dual RHW-4, and many of these complications are EXE-locked and therefore unfixable.
First, the same paths are used for both sides of the MHW tunnel, making asymmetrical pathing impossible, so two-tile RHWs, such as RHW-8S, are out of the question. Secondly, only one tunnel model can be used for each tunnel, since there is no way to drag out and select different tunnels the same way that bridges can be selected and drawn. Thirdly, changing the function of a feature that already works, the MHW tunnels, so that another mod can use is not good practise, as it will cause existing tunnels to cease functioning.
Questions Regarding Cross-Compatibility with Other Mods # Can this work with RHW? # It most certainly can. It’s designed to do just that.
Can this work with other MHW mods? # That depends on what type of mod it is. If it’s a mod that modifies the models, such as the HRS , then it will actually conflict with the Maxis Highway Override. Simple textural mods that work for MHW will not even work with MHO, since the MHO references completely different textures.
T21 modifications may still continue to work with MHO, but depending on how the props are placed, they may be misaligned with the new dimensional specifications.
Questions Regarding Textures # I want to change the textures. What should I look for? # First, you need to know how to mod textures. There are several tutorials about that. The important thing is that the override textures have the same IDs as the original ones. You can find the original textures in the DAT-files of the RHW for reference. You can check out the Maxis Highway Override DATs for texture references of every model. However, changes to MHO textures will also have effect on the elevated RHW. Keep that in mind.
What about Euro Textures? # These are available and included in the NAM.
Questions Regarding General Development # When it will be out? # It will be ready when it’s ready. Besides, who doesn’t like surprises? ;)

As it does not affect the surrounding sections of network, the Network Eraser is safer to use and less destructive when one needs to remove or rebuild a section of network than the game\u0026rsquo;s Bulldozer tool, especially when complex setups are involved. It can be found near the top of the Roads, Highways, Rails, and Misc. Transit menus.
To use the Network Eraser, simply select it from the menu, hover it over the stretch of network you wish to erase, and then click it to erase.
The Network Eraser can work on any draggable intersection combination between two different networks:
It can also work on FLEX Pieces, such as this RealHighway (RHW) FLEXRamp:
It does not, however, work on old-style puzzle pieces or Maxis Highway interchanges (notice how attempting to hover over the interchange puts the Network Eraser one tile to the side):
Note also that some very specialized draggable network items, such as the RealHighway Inside Ramps, utilize the Eraser as part of the process of building the appropriate network pattern.
Hole Diggers and Raisers # The Hole Diggers and Raisers in the NAM allow one to raise or lower a single cell/tile (1x1) of terrain to a precise elevation level, allowing for finer control of terraforming. This can be particularly useful when dealing with elevated networks (and especially with On-Slope Transitions), and building tunnels and bridgges. Like the Network Eraser, the Hole Diggers and Raisers are available under the Roads, Highways, Rails, and Misc. Transit menus:
There are 15 different Hole Digger/Raiser pairs available, each resulting in a different degree of elevation change. TAB and Shift-TAB (Ctrl-TAB and Ctrl-Shift-TAB on Mac) will cycle through the different elevation change levels, while Home and End allow one to toggle between Raise (blue) and Dig (red).
In order, these are the elevation changes available:
15 meters (15m) 7.5 meters (7.5m) 8 meters (8m) 10 meters (10m) 12 meters (12m) 14 meters (14m) 15.5 meters (15.5m) 22.5 meters (22.5m) 24 meters (24m) 30 meters (30m) 0.1 meters (0.1m) 0.5 meters (0.5m) 1 meter (1m) 2 meters (2m) 5 meters (5m) To use the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Hole Diggers and Raisers, once you\u0026rsquo;ve selected the desired one, and click the cell/tile. The terrain on that cell/tile will be automatically raised or lowered by the specified amount. Unlike other Hole Digger and Raiser Lots, the NAM Hole Diggers and Raisers auto-destruct after placement, allowing one to build on top of the newly-altered terrain immediately.
While the Hole Diggers and Raisers operate on a single cell/tile (1x1) basis, it is easily possible to extend the area of the effect by clicking a simple 1x1 Road stub on top of the newly-altered terrain, and then clicking additional 1x1 Road stubs adjacent to it, outlining the additional areas that you would like to bring to the same elevation level.

NWM Override Networks # Overview
The Network Widening Mod (NWM) plugin includes a total of 13 different override networks, which can be grouped into four classes: Roads (RD), One-Way Roads (OWR), [Road-based] Avenues (AVE), and [Road-based] Turning Lane Avenues (TLA).
All of these override networks can either be constructed by first placing a Starter Piece, then dragging the appropriate default network through the starter, at which point the draggable network should convert to match the starter. This process is shown below on a Road-based NWM Override Network.
(Click for full resolution)
Open image in new tab In the case of multi-tile override networks, they are still based off default single-tile networks, mainly due to limitations with the game\u0026rsquo;s default dual-tile networks, and lack of triple-tile networks. Simply use the same process for each tile in the starter to complete the network.
(Click for full resolution)
Open image in new tab Turning Lane Avenues (TLA) [Road-based] # The Turning Lane Avenues, or TLAs, are Road-based override networks that include a paved/flush center turn lane running down the median, as is especially common in North America. In the case of the multi-tile variants, the existence of this center turn lane allows for vehicles to directly access buildings and lots on the far side of the network\u0026ndash;something which the game\u0026rsquo;s default Avenue network does not allow.
There are three total TLA networks presently included in the NWM (note that the center turn lane is included in the lane count associated with each network).
3-Lane Turning Lane Avenue (TLA-3) [Single Tile] 5-Lane Turning Lane Avenue (TLA-5) [Dual Tile] 7-Lane Turning Lane Avenue (TLA-7) [Triple Tile] Open image in new tab Avenues (AVE) [Road-based] # The Avenues, or AVEs, are Road-based (not Avenue-based\u0026ndash;though as of NAM 46, the AVE-6 can be built by using overlapping Avenues for orthogonal stretches) override networks that include a landscaped median divider, much like the game\u0026rsquo;s default 4-lane Avenue network. Unlike the TLAs, the AVEs do not allow direct access to buildings and lots on the far side of the network.
2-Lane Avenue (AVE-2) [Single Tile] 6-Lane Avenue (AVE-6) [Triple Tile] Open image in new tab Roads (RD) [Road-based] # The Roads, or RDs, are Road-based override networks that do not feature a median, similar to the game\u0026rsquo;s default Road network in appearance, but with more lanes. Unlike the TLAs, the RDs do not allow direct access to buildings and lots on the far side of the network.
3-Lane Asymmetrical Road (ARD-3) [Single Tile] 4-Lane Narrow Road (NRD-4) [Single Tile] 4-Lane Road (RD-4) [Dual Tile] 6-Lane Road (RD-6) [Dual Tile] Open image in new tab One-Way Roads (OWR) [One-Way Road-based] # The One-Way Roads, or OWRs, are One-Way Road-based override networks that, in contrast to the other networks in the NWM, only allow traffic in a single direction, but feature differing numbers of lanes compared to the game\u0026rsquo;s default 2-lane One-Way Road setup. Similar to the default One-Way Road network, directionality of each NWM OWR network is determined by draw direction, and these width variants can have their direction reversed in the same way. Due to the presence of crossover paths on the multi-tile variants, it is possible for vehicles to reach buildings and lots on the far side of the network.
1-Lane One-Way Road (OWR-1) [Single Tile] 3-Lane One-Way Road (OWR-3) [Single Tile] 4-Lane One-Way Road (OWR-4) [Dual Tile] 5-Lane One-Way Road (OWR-5) [Dual Tile] Open image in new tab Constructing Diagonals and Curves # The diagonal functionality for the single-tile NWM networks is straightforward (and diagonal starters are provided for all single-tile networks, except the NRD-4), but dual and triple-tile NWM networks may prove to be less intuitive at first, as there are different construction methods used, depending on the network.
The RD-4 and OWR-4 operate on a \u0026ldquo;shared-tile\u0026rdquo; setup.

Note that, except in the case of setups not otherwise covered, the Puzzle Piece method is largely considered deprecated/outdated, due to its lack of support for wealth-level textures.
Draggable Stub Method # The Draggable Stub Method is used to transition between an override network and its base network (i.e. from ARD-3 to Road) or between two override networks sharing the same base network (i.e. from RD-4 to RD-6). In order to create transitions that use this method, simply drag each network such that the end stubs of each network are right next to one another, as seen below on the left. Provided the combination of networks is one that is supported, the stubs will convert into a transition between the networks, as seen on the right. This method will also work for networks of different tile widths (i.e. TLA-3 to TLA-5)
Open image in new tab Direct Connection Method # The Direct Connection Method is generally used to transition between an override network and a network (default or override) built from a different base (i.e. from TLA-5 to Avenue, or from TLA-3 to RHW-2). In order to create transitions that use this method, simply drag one network into the other, similar to the fashion shown below. Provided the combination of networks is one that is supported, the direct connection will convert into a transition between the networks, as seen on the right.
Open image in new tab Puzzle Piece Method LEGACY # The Puzzle Piece Method entails using the items found under the NWM Transition Puzzle Pieces button. To create a transition, simply find the desired puzzle piece from the menu, aligning the preview to where one wishes to place it, and clicking to plop the piece. Note that some of the puzzle-based transitions do not have NWM Starters on their ends, and the base network setup must be built before plopping the puzzle piece.
Note: With the exception of some setups that are not supported any other way, the Puzzle Piece Method is deprecated/outdated. All future additions to the repertoire of NWM transitions will be in draggable form, using either the Draggable Stub or Direct Connection Methods, as appropriate. Draggable treatments for all of the existing puzzle pieces are planned for a future NAM release.
A full listing of supported draggable transitions can be found in the Network Capabilities section. A listing of the existing transition puzzle pieces can be found in the Menu Items section.
Capacities and Speeds # The capacity of each network depends on the Traffic Plugin one has installed. Capacity is generally calculated on a per tile basis by the game. All NWM networks are also surface street-type networks, meaning that they allow full access to RCI Zones. The capacities for the five standard capacity levels of the NAM Traffic Plugin are listed below. Please note that these capacities listed are for the full width of the network, rather than the per-tile capacity.
With the exception of the OWR-1 and RD-4 networks, which share the same capacity as their respective base networks, all other NWM networks have a capacity that is 125% of that of the base network used in the override network setup, as a result of using a special pathing setup that allows a one-time capacity boost of 25%. This is why the NRD-4, despite having an additional lane, has the same capacity as the other boosted single-tile networks, as well as why the OWR-1 has the same capacity as the base One-Way Road. Since crossover paths on multi-tile override networks trigger the boost, the OWR-5 has the same capacity as the OWR-4, though the use of a split tile diagonals on the OWR-5 will give it a higher diagonal capacity than the OWR-4 and its shared tile diagonals.

Since many of the NWM networks have a boosted capacity, they will not reach the 100% figure as quickly, thereby allowing for higher speeds at higher volumes.

Network and FLEX Piece Capabilities # Key # Yes This particular feature can be constructed, with minimal (if any) limitations. Partial Support This particular feature can be constructed, but not in all instances. Details will be given as to what is/is not possible. Partial support may be for intentional design reasons (such as realism or general unfeasibility), or simply because the feature has not been fully developed. Limited Support This particular feature can be constructed, but only in extremely limited circumstances. Instances that are possible may be listed, insofar as it is possible. Use at your own risk. No Support This particular feature cannot be constructed. This restriction could be for intentional design reasons (such as realism, general unfeasibility, or game limitations), or simply because it has not yet been developed. Additional Notes # T-End Min: If the given network is to end at a T-intersection, this value is the minimum number of total lanes that needs to be on the cross network. For instance, while an RD-6 (T-End Min = 3) can end at an ARD-3 (3 total thru lanes), it cannot end at a Road (2 total thru lanes). Center lanes on TLA networks do not count toward the overall figure (i.e. the TLA-5 would be considered to have 4 lanes total in this instance).
T-In Max: If a cross network ends at the given network in a T-intersection, this value is the maximum number of lanes on the cross network heading inbound to the T-intersection (half the network, in the case of a two-way network, the full network if one-way). For instance, an AVE-2 can have an Avenue or RD-4 end at it (AVE-2 T-In Max = 2, while the Avenue and RD-4 have 4 lanes total, 2 heading inbound to the intersection), but an OWR-1 cannot (T-In Max = 1). Center lanes on TLA networks do not count toward the overall figure (i.e. the TLA-5 would be considered to have 4 lanes total in this instance).
OxO: OxO stands for \u0026ldquo;orthogonal x orthogonal\u0026rdquo;, and refers to a situation where both networks are orthogonal (in a straight line) along the game\u0026rsquo;s grid, intersecting perpendicularly (at 90° angles at all corners).
OxD: OxD stands for \u0026ldquo;orthogonal x diagonal\u0026rdquo;, and refers to a situation where the given network is orthogonal (in a straight line) along the game\u0026rsquo;s grid, and the cross network is diagonal (running at a 45° angle).
DxO: DxO stands for \u0026ldquo;diagonal x orthogonal\u0026rdquo;, and refers to a situation where the base network is diagonal (running at a 45° angle), and the cross network is orthogonal (in a straight line) along the game\u0026rsquo;s grid.
DxD: DxD stands for \u0026ldquo;diagonal x diagonal\u0026rdquo;, and refers to a situation where both networks are diagonal (running at a 45° angle) along the game\u0026rsquo;s grid, intersecting perpendicularly (at 90° angles at all corners).

Introduction # The NAM Team is proud to present the newest network family, the Pedestrian Revolution Mod! This network family encompasses all future network features intended for active transportation modes, including pedestrian, cycling and true multimodal corridors. The network family will consist of two broad classes of content: FLEX-based crossing facilities and draggable pedestrian-oriented corridors. Over time, more network features will be added to this family, vastly expanding the potential city designs for the entire SimCity 4 community.
Midblock Crosswalks # Version 45 of the Network Addon Mod introduced the first FLEX-based pedestrian-oriented transportation features, the Midblock Crosswalks. This feature starts with 9 pieces which provide dedicated Pedestrian crossings for use away from surface road intersections. These pieces are found inside the new menu named Pedestrian Revolution Mod (PRM) FLEX crossings, located between the Street Addon Mod starter pieces and the Avenue Intersections (Roundabouts) menus.
The initial set of 9 pieces provides crossings for all the bidirectional surface road networks: Road, Avenue, and the two-way (Road-based) Network Widening Mod overrides. Each network width has 3 sizes, measured based on the length of the crosswalk piece. All pieces use a crossing table or raised crosswalk design, where the road pavement is raised to sidewalk height, providing a continuous walking surface for pedestrians, along with traffic calming for motor vehicles.
Size 1 crosswalks use a simple and narrow design, with all the single tile networks, and most double tile networks (except RD-6) using stop control. RD-6, AVE-6 and TLA-7 use traffic signal control. The Size 2 and 3 crosswalks use a full width crosswalk design and pavement markings, indicating the approach side of the vehicle lanes. As of NAM 45, all designs use traffic signals as their traffic control. All pieces provide a traffic calming effect, where motor vehicles slow down along the crosswalk, are slightly raised when going over the raised crosswalk, and stop before the stop line.
The Midblock Crosswalks can be constructed using two general procedures: overplop over an existing network, or construction over blank terrain. The overplop method consists of finding the desired network segment for the crosswalk, aligning the crosswalk piece using the construction tile cursor and the HOME/END keys. Once the desired alignment is found, click to place the FLEX piece, then use the Road or Avenue tool, as appropriate, to connect across the gap formed by the construction tile.
The second method consists of first placing the crosswalk piece and a starter, such that they\u0026rsquo;re aligned. Then, using the Road or Avenue network tool, as appropriate, connect the starter to the crosswalk. Make sure to drag at least 2 tiles beyond the crosswalk piece, to avoid creating the Road/AVE-2 width transition used for the refuge island configurations. Pay attention to the construction preview to ensure the correct configuration is being made. Once done, release the network tool cursor and admire your new piece of pedestrian infrastructure!
Both double and triple tile networks support the overplop method the same way the single tile networks do. The size 3 triple tile network crosswalks, due to their complexity, do require some extra help to get their full override. When placing the size 3 crosswalk piece for use with TLA-7 or AVE-6, make sure to provide the override from both sides. The override works fully along the median lanes, but the override for the outer lanes works only from the inbound lanes (approach side of crosswalk). To ensure the override completes, provide either another TLA-7 or AVE-6 starter, or connect with the existing triple tile NWM segment.
The road crosswalks support refuge island crosswalk designs, where the lanes are temporarily separated to provide a mid-point stopping location for pedestrians, which allows them to cross one traffic direction at a time. To build, select the Road tool and drag out a 1-tile end stub out of the crosswalk ends, which will form half of the width transition between Road and the 2-lane Avenue (AVE-2). Then, drag a road segment towards the width transition, making sure not to connect across. The end stub will automatically override the Road half of the Road/AVE-2 width transition.
Likewise, a refuge island configuration can be build by pairing the Avenue crosswalks with RD-4. To do so, start by placing an Avenue crosswalk, leaving at least a 2-tile gap (preferably 3 or more tiles) before putting RD-4 starters, if necessary. Then, using the Avenue tool, drag 2-tile stubs extending out of the Avenue crosswalk piece, then connect them to RD-4 using the Road Tool, repeat for the opposite end. The result will be a refuge island configuration for RD-4, transitioning to a short Avenue segment.
The crosswalk pieces are designed to support uniform wealthing textures. The resulting texture will depend on which zones, lots and buildings are placed next to the crosswalk, but is guaranteed to cover the entire piece with the same texture type. They also support full sidewalk texture coverage in tight spaces, such as a crosswalk exposed to zoned land or lots from one side or even one corner. Players can control the appearance by changing which zones, buildings, and lots the crosswalks touch, the same way Avenues support continuous zoning textures based on the most common type of zone density and wealth along its alignment.
The 3 size options allow players to select the optimal size of the crosswalk to match their intended application. Sizes 1 and 3 are recommended for use in front of odd-length buildings and city blocks, where they can be centered with the building\u0026rsquo;s front side (city hall example), or the mid-point of transportation network between intersections. Size 2 is recommended for use in front of even-length buildings and city blocks (high school example), centered in the same manner. All crosswalks support access to RCI development, unlike their transit lot predecessors. They can also connect to transit stations and to pedmall puzzle pieces, without the need of transit stops as an intermediary.

The contents of this document are undergoing revision and are subject to change. Development History # The RealRailway or (RRW) is the new standard for rail transport in the NAM. RealRailway supersedes Maxis Rail and Railway Addon Mod (RAM). RRW is the only standard of rail receiving continual updates by the NAM Team since 2013 (NAM 32). Many enhancements, such as FlexTrack, Fractional Angled Rails (FARR), and the draggable Elevated RealRailway (ERRW) are products exclusive to the RealRailway.
The RealRailway began with \u0026ldquo;mini-curves\u0026rdquo;, which were to replace the existing Maxis curves and turnouts with a more realistic minimum curve radius:
Numerous other improvements followed including:
Changing the gauge to represent standard gauge (1435 mm), which approximates to 12 pixels in absolute terms. Changing the track spacing from 4 meters to 4.5 meters. The founder of the project, Swordmaster, determined the best way to make realistic railways by spacing out the tracks with the new gauge which makes the outer rails run flush with the Maxis rails but not with the inner rails.
The following is a snapshot from the initial 2013 RealRailway documentation which demonstrates the rationale for the shift to the RRW standard:
Notice how the road pieces line up with the real life road networks but the Maxis Rail does not!
At first, RealRailway was basic in appearance and functionality. However, further enhancements have led to RRW surpassing the functionality of Maxis rail in the NAM.
Basic Usage # RealRailway is a complete replacement of the rail network. Basic double-track rail (DTR) is drawn using the rail tool and advanced functionality is achieved with draggable patterns or ploppable FLEX pieces. Single-track rail (STR) is provided as an override network and can initiated by a dedicated starter or by certain FLEX turnouts. RRW also covers legacy DTR puzzle pieces and wide radius curves.
An explanation of the RRW menu icons is given below.
FlexTrack # NAM 33 delivered a suite of new functionality to the RealRailway known as FlexTrack. This advancement allowed for medium to large wide radius curves rechristened as multi-radius curves (MRC). Under the MRC nomenclature, sizes range from the smallest existing minicurves at R1 to large, sweeping curves at R5. Patterns were devised to allow the curves to drawn out with the rail tool without having to go into the puzzle piece tab loop. R1, R2 and R3 can also be made into turnouts by drawing orthogonally from the orthogonal end while there is support for diagonal turnouts with R1 and R3. R4 and R5 do not support any turnouts with there sole function to be curves! Also a range of new turnout options were introduced with the RealRailway FlexTrack component. This allowed for new turnouts in tight situations where the former parts where not applicable or accessible. FlexTrack improvements were spearheaded by eggman121 who developed the new components building on the base provided by Swordmaster.
The FlexTrack currently relies on patterns to make the desired curves or turnouts/ switches. While there is the advantage of not having to go into the menu to find the pieces they can be hard to find the right patterns with conflicts if the pieces are too close to each other. Testing the capabilities in a blank region is always helpful to get the right patterns for the FlexTrack component.
The patterns and resultants are shown below.
Curves # Drag pattern MRC R2 Drag pattern MRC R3 Drag pattern MRC R4 Drag pattern MRC R5 Drag pattern RRW Orthogonal S-Curve Drag pattern RRW Diagonal S-Curve Macro Curves # At the start of the TAB loop for FLEX-Pieces there are a number of Pieces called macro-curves and switches. These are switches with wider geometry than previously-developed mini-curves which occupy a similar footprint. The curves and switches are offered as FLEX only due to the drag patterns arlready being used for the mini-curves. Macro-curves and switches are quite flexible in that drawing the rail tool through the piece placed down can make an array of different switches as shown in the table below.
Fractional Angle Railroad (FARR) # Fractional Angle Rail Road (FARR) is the angled sections of track that conform to three angles which compiment the orthogonal (0 degrees) and diagional (45 degrees). They are FARR-3 (18.43 degrees), FARR-2 (26.56 degrees) and FARR-1.5 (33.69 degrees). FARR was originally developed to use drag patterns as the means of creation, however, the majority these patterns were replaced by FLEX piece implementation with NAM 37. FARR Flex piece usage and remaining drag patterns are documented in this section.

FARR-2 Alt # The FARR-2 Alt has the same angle as the normal FARR-2 but has a different base and pattern. Also the geometry is slightly different and can make complex turnouts as shown further in the document. The FARR-2 Alternative implementation is considered a FlexTrack item. Below are the various setups. The base for the FARR-2 Alt is the zig zag base and is designed for flat surfaces only. This section of track has no slope tolerance.

Turnouts # The turnouts and switches come in all sorts of forms and there are a range of turnouts to use. They range from A1 Turnouts to large B2 extended turnouts as well. The set classes are shown in the table below. Not all the turnouts have been made. Some of the possibilities will need flex implementation to be realised. The table shown is just an example of the proposed turnouts. Additional turnouts have been made possible however for the Real Railway.

Upgrading to DTR involves drawing through the middle points as shown by the red arrow.
Elevated RealRailway (ERRW) # Elevated RealRailway (ERRW) is the draggable implementation of heavy rail viaducts. ERRW is implemented at both L1 (7.5m) and L2 (15.5m). Both variants include support for some minicurves and multi radius curves. The MRCs supported are Radius (1, 2 and 3).
Height Transitions # Switching between ground level (L0) RRW and ERRW is accomplished using FLEX transition pieces found in the Draggable Elevated Railways (ERRW) menu.
Usage Notes # The rail is not to be drawn through the transition but to the stub at each end shown in the pictures below\u0026hellip;
White represents the adjoining stub connections while Black represents the network you want to cross.
Upon a successful draw you should see something like this\u0026hellip;
This is the preview of the ERRW before placing it. Previews are in-place for the majority of the ERRW.
On-Slope Transitions # Orthogonal on-slope transitions support the following configurations:
L0 to L2 (15.5m embankment) L1 to L2 (8m embankment) L0 to L1 (7.5m embankment) Diagonal on-slope transitions support the following configurations:
L0 to L2 (15.5m embankment) L0 to L1 (7.5m embankment) Ramp-style Transitions # It is also possible to transition from RRW to ERRW using ramp-style transitions.
Curves and Turnouts # As mentioned above the R1, R2 and R3 curves can have overrides at each level for making elevated smooth curves. They use the flextrack base to work so they only work with the RRW flextrack curves.

As such, it requires that the Network Widening Mod be installed as part of one\u0026rsquo;s NAM installation. The REW\u0026rsquo;s ramps can be used to recreate urban and suburban surface arterials that have expressway/freeway-like features, Texas-style frontage roads supporting RCI development/access (especially in combination with RealHighways), or various novel intersection configurations.
Building REW Ramp Interfaces # There are two methods of building REW Ramp Interfaces: using the FLEX Pieces (found under the RealExpressway One-Way Road FLEXRamps button on the Roads Menu), or through draggable means (only available for certain ramps).
The FLEX Pieces are the simpler way to build REW ramps. First, under the REW Ramp Interfaces button, cycle through TAB or Shift-TAB (Ctrl-TAB or Ctrl-Shift-TAB on Mac) to the desired ramp interface, and place it. Then, drag the One-Way Road tool through the mainline, and finally, through the ramp\u0026ndash;which, in this case, will convert to the 1-Lane One-Way Road network (OWR-1) from the Network Widening Mod (NWM). In the case of the Road splitter ramps (new to NAM 45), use the Road network out the top of the ramp instead.
As the REW FLEXRamps use special network flags to counteract the game\u0026rsquo;s hardcoded \u0026ldquo;Tidal Flow\u0026rdquo; system of determining the direction of a One-Way Road, they are effectively bidirectionally-pathed at all times (as shown in the image below, in which the DrawPaths cheat from SimCity 4 Extra Cheats.dll has been turned on). The directionality is irrelevant. Note, however, that this means that REW FLEXRamps CANNOT be placed directly over an existing stretch of One-Way Road (or an NWM OWR). One must use the Bulldozer or the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Network Eraser to make a place for the FLEXRamp to be plopped.
The Draggable Ramp Interfaces (DRIs) behave differently, and are not bidirectionally-pathed, instead aligning with the Tidal Flow system. Note that in both cases, separate Outside and Inside ramps are not needed, unlike the RHW\u0026rsquo;s ramp system.
The build methods are shown below:
A1 Orthogonal Ramp B1 Orthogonal Ramp A1 Diagonal Ramp B1 Diagonal Ramp The nomenclature for REW ramps is essentially the same as for the RHW.
Type A1 Type B1 Type D1 Type E1 Type A2 Type B2 Type D2 Type E2 A1: Indicates a single-lane (OWR-1) branch off the mainline, with an orthogonal branch. No lanes peel off the mainline. B1: Indicates a single-lane (OWR-1) branch off the mainline, with a diagonal branch. No lanes peel off the mainline. D1: Indicates a single-lane (OWR-1) branch off the mainline, with an orthogonal branch. The branch is formed from one lane of the mainline, and the mainline has one fewer lane at the bottom. E1: Indicates a single-lane (OWR-1) branch off the mainline, with a diagonal branch. The branch is formed from one lane of the mainline, and the mainline has one fewer lane at the bottom. A2: Indicates a dual-lane (OWR-2) branch off the mainline, with an orthogonal branch. One of the two lanes on the branch is from the mainline, and the mainline has one fewer lane at the bottom. B2: Indicates a dual-lane (OWR-2) branch off the mainline, with a diagonal branch. One of the two lanes on the branch is from the mainline, and the mainline has one fewer lane at the bottom. D2: Indicates a dual-lane (OWR-2) branch off the mainline, with an orthogonal branch. Both lanes on the branch are from the mainline, and the mainline has two fewer lanes at the bottom. E2: Indicates a dual-lane (OWR-2) branch off the mainline, with a diagonal branch. Both lanes on the branch are from the mainline, and the mainline has two fewer lanes at the bottom. Below is a list of the modifiers:
Inside: This designation is seen on ramps from one-way RHW networks, and indicates that the ramp branch is on the inside (left exit/entrance in countries with right-hand traffic, right exit/entrance for those with left-hand traffic), rather than the expected outside. Wide: This designation indicates that the ramp branch has a larger separation than the standard version of that type, and is most commonly applied to A1 and A2 ramps. Wye: This designation indicates that both the branch and the mainline (often when the mainline is of the same width as the branch) both diverge from the path of the mainline at the top in a symmetrical fashion, forming a wishbone or Y-shape. Shift: This is an indication that the mainline undergoes curvature in the midst of the ramp. This occurs when the mainline shifts tile widths. Dual: This is an indication that there are two ramp branches on the ramp interface. This is most commonly seen with the bidirectional networks, or in conjunction with Shift. Folded: This is an indication that there are two ramp branches that curve off at 90-degree angles, in opposite directions. There is only one Folded ramp interface in the REW, the Road D1 Folded Wye. Diagonal: This designation indicates that the mainline is diagonal rather than orthogonal. The branch angles are handled the same as if the ramp were orthogonal (i.e. an orthogonal ramp branch off a diagonal ramp interface would still be an A or D-type ramp of some sort). FA: This designation indicates that the mainline is at a fractional angle rather than orthogonal. The branch angles are handled the same as if the ramp were orthogonal (i.e. an orthogonal ramp branch off an FA ramp interface would still be an A or D-type ramp of some sort). The current set of FLEXRamps available for the REW (22 in total) is shown below:
`}),e.add({id:33,href:"/docs/feature-guides/realhighway-mod/",title:"RealHighway Mod",description:'The RealHighway (RHW) system is a series of new highway networks added by the NAM, based on the reactivated stub of an unfinished transportation network (originally intended as a "DirtRoad" network) that Maxis left in the game.',content:` The documentation on this page is in progress. The contents of this document are undergoing revision and are subject to change. Installing the RealHighways from the NAM Installer # A complete install of the RealHighway plugin is one of the features included by default in the NAM Installer. There is a whole section dedicated to the RealHighways and related optional features.
Under the \u0026ldquo;2 Additional Network Features\u0026rdquo; section, selecting the \u0026ldquo;RealHighway\u0026rdquo; box will install the mod in its entirety. Deselecting any of the other boxes under this section should only be done by advanced users who are manually compiling a NAM Controller to exclude certain RHW networks.
Note that the RHW requires a 4GB_Full NAM Controller, and as such, also requires the 4GB Patch. It is the largest component in the NAM package by a wide margin, and requires a 64-bit operating system and at least 4GB RAM to utilize.
Euro textures for the RealHighways will be automatically installed if one selects one of the Euro road texture options.
RealHighway Base and Override Networks # The RealHighway system avails itself of the only unfinished network stub left in the game (formerly known as the ANT - the Additional Network Tool; or the DirtRoad network), and adds a true base network, the 2-lane RealHighway (RHW-2), along with 36 override networks based upon it. With the exception of the Modular Interchange System (MIS) Ramp override network, the nomenclature used for RealHighway networks distinguishes the networks by the total number of lanes it would require to facilitate two-way traffic with the network. For instance, while each individual tile of the 4-lane RealHighway (RHW-4) may only carry 2 lanes going in one direction, full bidirectional traffic with the network would require 2 stretches of the network traveling in opposite directions, thereby resulting in a total of 4 lanes.
With some of the wider networks, the letters \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; may be added after the lane count designation (i.e. RHW-8S or RHW-6C). The \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; is an indication for \u0026ldquo;separable\u0026rdquo;, meaning that the lanes carrying travel in the opposite direction may be separated by any distance. The \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; stands for \u0026ldquo;combined\u0026rdquo;, and the center tile of the \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; override carries the median separating the two directions of traffic, thereby making it inseparable. While the smaller networks do not have \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; suffixes, the RHW-2 and RHW-3 may be thought of as small C-type networks, and the MIS Ramp and RHW-4 as S-type networks.
It is also possible to make ad hoc asymmetrical networks as well. For instance, one could create a 5-lane highway by using the RHW-4 on one side, and an RHW-6S on the other. The C-type networks, while not separable, also support this sort of functionality, and a dedicated starter exists for an \u0026ldquo;RHW-7C\u0026rdquo;, which uses parts of the RHW-8C and RHW-6C for construction.
There are also multiple elevation levels for the RealHighway override networks as well, and a simple shorthand system of denoting each level. Ground-level networks, by virtue of having no elevation above the terrain, are deemed to be \u0026ldquo;Level 0\u0026rdquo;, or L0. The RealHighway levels increment by 7.5 meters (7.5m) each level. Level 1 (L1) is at 7.5 meters, Level 2 (L2) at 15 meters, Level 3 (L3) at 22.5 meters, and Level 4 (L4) at 30 meters. All RealHighway widths have L1 and L2 elevation at their disposal, and the MIS Ramp, RHW-4, and RHW-6S all have the ability to reach L3 and L4. Double-decker (DD) setups also exist (presently, only in a configuration with 4 total lanes, the DDRHW-4), and the upper deck of the DDRHW is at L2, while the lower deck is at L1.
The base draggable network can be found under the RHW-2 button.
RHW-2 Network Button The Starter Pieces can be found under the RHW Starters button.
RHW Starters Button RealHighway Network Widths # The following networks are included as part of the RealHighway mod.

This means that the shoulder will overlap part of the adjacent tile. This is much more noticeable on the RHW-6S than on the RHW-12S.
All widths of the RealHighway have access to L1 and L2 elevations, which are produced with separate starters. The MIS, RHW-4, and RHW-6S also have access to L3 and L4 elevations (only installed by selecting the appropriate options in the Custom Installation section of the NAM Installer), and as previously mentioned, the RHW-4 also has a double-decker form, the DDRHW-4 (decks at L1 and L2).
Starter Pieces # All of these override networks can either be constructed by first placing a Starter Piece, then dragging the appropriate default network through the starter, at which point the draggable network should convert to match the starter. This process is shown below.
In the case of multi-tile override networks, they are still based off default single-tile networks, mainly due to limitations with the game\u0026rsquo;s default dual-tile networks, and lack of triple-tile networks. Simply use the same process for each tile in the starter to complete the network.
Additionally, RHW Starter Pieces can be crossed by other RHW networks, allowing for maximally-stable highway-over-highway crossings.
Zone Access Restrictions # The RealHighway family of networks is considered to be Highway-type by the game, and as such, this limits its ability to provide direct access to zones and buildings, as one would expect from a highway. This limitation is especially true of Residential (R) zones, which cannot be built at all along RHW networks, and attempting to have any zone type use RealHighway network frontage for access is not recommended. It is instead recommended that one downgrade to a non-highway network, such as the Road, One-Way Road, or one of the Network Widening Mod override networks if zone access is required.
Capacities and Speeds # The capacity of each network depends on the Traffic Plugin one has installed. Capacity is generally calculated on a per tile basis by the game, as the game cannot read the number of lanes.
All RHW networks are also highway-type networks, meaning that they do not allow full access to RCI Zones. The capacities for the five standard capacity levels of the NAM Traffic Plugin are listed below. Please note that these capacities listed are for the full width of the network, rather than the per-tile capacity.
Note that networks with crossover paths (i.e. the RHW-6C, RHW-8S, RHW-8C, RHW-10S, and RHW-12S), and those that use a special workaround (the RHW-3, DDRHW-4, and RHW-6S) have a 25% boost on capacity over the normal per-tile figure for the base RHW network. This boost can only be applied once, which is why the DDRHW-4, despite having one more lane than the RHW-3, has the same capacity. A similar situation exists with the RHW-6C and RHW-8C, and the RHW-8S and RHW-10S.
Note that these figures also apply to all elevated versions of each network width - this means that the L0 RHW-4 will have the same capacity as its L1, L2, L3, and L4 counterparts.

Note, however, that these catalog speeds are for 100% of catalog capacity, and that speeds on empty networks will exceed these figures by 30%, declining as the networks increase in volume per the Congestion vs. Speed Curve.

** Pedestrians are only allowed on the L0 RHW-2 newtork.
Constructing The RealHighway # The Disconnector: A RealHighway-Safe Bulldozer # Due to the vestigial remnants of the unfinished network stub, the base RealHighway network possesses an auto-connect functionality, similar to the way the Street network operates. This can make the network\u0026rsquo;s behavior rather erratic when using the game\u0026rsquo;s base Bulldoze tool, and may result in more being demolished than one intended, particularly when dealing with complicated interchanges constructed entirely from RealHighway components.
To combat this issue, the RealHighway plugin comes with an alternative demolition tool, known as the Disconnector, which can be found under the Disconnector button on the Highways menu.
RHW Disconnector Button Plopping the Disconnector over a single tile of RealHighway, including starter pieces, FLEX pieces, and intersections (but not puzzle pieces) will demolish only the tile directly under the cursor.
The Disconnector is also used as part of some Pattern-Based Draggable setups used by the RealHighway plugin, particularly the Draggable Ramp Interfaces (DRIs). Additionally, it can be used in many situations with non-RHW networks as well.
Constructing Diagonals and Base Curves # With the networks that are single-tile (RHW-2, RHW-3), or have self-contained single-tile halves (MIS, RHW-4, RHW-6S), one can simply drag the network out as would be normally expected in order to produce the curves to go diagonal with the network. Aside from the L0 RHW-2, however, the shared-tile \u0026ldquo;double diagonal\u0026rdquo; setup cannot be built, and pairs of MIS, RHW-4, and/or RHW-6S carriageways must be separated, out into a split-tile setup.
For the wider RHW networks (the RHW-8S, RHW-10S, RHW-12S, RHW-6C, and RHW-8C), the split-tile diagonal setup must be used.
The default sharp 90-degree bends are only available with the RHW-2 and MIS Ramp networks (at all height levels), for the sake of realism. The MIS Ramp\u0026rsquo;s version also overrides one \u0026ldquo;buffer tile\u0026rdquo; on either side of the bend itself, to produce a smoother result (one should take care not to impose upon these buffer tiles when building, as attempting to cram an intersection where they should go will simply destabilize the MIS Ramp override).
If one desires a smoother transition between orthogonal and diagonal, Wide-Radius Curves and Multi-Radius Curves provide a solution. Fractional Angle RealHighways (FARHW) are also available.
Connecting RealHighways via Intersections, Crossings and Interchanges # The RealHighway system has two ways of connecting and crossing other networks: At-Grade and Grade-Separated. The smaller RealHighway networks, including the RHW-2 (L0-L2), RHW-3 (L0 only), MIS (L0-L2), and RHW-4 (L0-L2), have the ability to intersect and cross other networks at the same height level. To build these crossings, simply drag the desired RealHighway network through or up to the crossing network to build the type of crossing you want, just as one would with any other draggable network in the game.
For grade-separated crossings, where networks at different height levels\u0026ndash;for instance, an L1 RHW-4 and the game\u0026rsquo;s default Elevated Rail network (which is at L2)\u0026ndash;follow the same exact process. All RealHighway networks at all height levels support grade-separated crossings.
For additional information about what network crossings are supported with the other components of the Network Addon Mod, refer to the Compatibility With Other Networks section of this document.
QuickChange Xpress: Full Interchanges in a Click # With the release of NAM 45 in mid-2022, the RealHighway has support for full ploppable interchanges, known as QuickChange Xpress (QCX). At present, only Diamond Interchanges involving the Road, Avenue, and 6-lane Avenue (AVE-6, from the Network Widening Mod) networks (with appropriate turn lanes applied on the surface networks and the on/offramps) exist. Four different RHW width configurations are supported (RHW-6S/RHW-4 Adjacent, RHW-6S/RHW-4 With Median, RHW-8C/6C, and RHW-10S/8S), and the option to have the RHW go over or under the surface street (in an L0/L1 configuration).
The QCX setups are located near the end of the TAB Loop under the RHW QuickChange button on the Highways Menu. TABing through will change the surface network width (Road or Avenue) and whether it or the RHW is elevated or the surface network is. Home/End rotation on each TAB entry will allow one to cycle through the different RHW widths/configurations supported.
To use a QCX, simply plop the interchange in its desired location/rotation, and connect it up with the surrounding networks. It\u0026rsquo;s really that easy!
Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab It is also possible to plop a QCX directly over an existing crossing.
Open image in new tab Open image in new tab On/Offramp (Ramp Interface) Basics # At the core of the RealHighway\u0026rsquo;s Modular Interchange System are the Ramp Interfaces, which allow exit and entrance ramps to branch off from or merge into the through lanes, or \u0026ldquo;mainline\u0026rdquo;, of a stretch of highway.
There are three possible ways to construct Ramp Interfaces:
FLEXRamps, which are ploppable, generally slope-tolerant, and conform to match the surrounding network via overrides. These can be found under the \u0026ldquo;FLEXRamps\u0026rdquo; button. Draggable Ramp Interfaces (DRI), which are Pattern-Based Draggable items, built by dragging the RealHighway network tool according to a specific pattern. Like the FLEXRamps, these will conform to match the surrounding network via overrides. Puzzle Piece Ramp Interfaces, which are conventional static puzzle pieces, many of which have starters attached to their ends. As these are static ploppables, they will not conform to the surrounding network, and one must select the specific puzzle piece for the desired network. This option is largely considered to be deprecated/outdated, with the exception of the few more specialized setups that have yet to receive FLEXRamp or DRI treatments. These can be found under the \u0026ldquo;Ramps\u0026rdquo; button. Note that there are some types of ramps that may only be possible through a certain construction method. FLEXRamps and DRIs are the preferred method for most ramp interfaces, and are the only option for most ramps involving elevated RealHighway networks. The puzzle piece method does presently contain a few specialized types that have not been made into FLEXRamp or DRI setups, however. A full listing of capabilities can be found here, and there is also a listing of all ploppable items (including FLEX and Puzzle Pieces). More details on constructing each type can be found below.
In order to use a ramp interface to connect a RealHighway to one\u0026rsquo;s surface network, first, build the desired ramp interface. Then, from the end of the branch, simply drag the RealHighway network tool out from it, just like using a starter piece. The network will convert to match the ramp. From there, simply continue dragging in the desired pattern, adding curves and transitions as necessary, and intersect the surface street with an At-Grade Crossing. (Note that the Fractional Angle ramps, Types C and F, do not support dragging, and the appropriate Fractional Angle RealHighway (FARHW) puzzle pieces must be used instead.)
In order to connect to another RealHighway, follow the same process, but instead of forming an At-Grade Crossing, simply connect the ramp into another Ramp Interface on the other RealHighway.
There are a number of different types of Ramp Interfaces included in the plugin, but at their core, they serve one purpose\u0026ndash;to connect RealHighway-based freeways/motorways to the surface streets, or other RealHighway-based freeways/motorways. There are two, sometimes three or even four parts to the name of each ramp interface type. These indicate the mainline width, the branch angle and width, as well as whether any of the branch lanes were \u0026ldquo;exit only\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;acceleration\u0026rdquo; lanes, added or subtracted from the mainline. Some more specialized ramp interfaces may append that fourth part, containing other information about the nature and location of the branch in relation to the mainline. The mainline portion will always indicate the width of the \u0026ldquo;top\u0026rdquo; portion of the ramp interface, where the mainline is guaranteed to be at its widest. In the case of FLEXRamps, since they are often shared by multiple networks, which override a base version, the mainline network is usually excluded from the in-game description. For the \u0026ldquo;type\u0026rdquo; designation, the number indicates the number of lanes included in the branch, while the letter indicates the branch angle and indicates whether the branch has any lanes that peel off (on exit) or join (on entrance) the mainline. The letter/number types translate as follows:
Type A1 Type B1 Type C1 Type D1 Type E1 Type F1 Type A2 Type B2 Type C2 Type D2 Type E2 Type F2 Type A3 Type B3
Not available Type C3 Type D3 Type E3
Not available Type F3
Not available A1: Indicates a single-lane (MIS Ramp) branch off the mainline, with an orthogonal branch. No lanes peel off the mainline. B1: Indicates a single-lane (MIS Ramp) branch off the mainline, with a diagonal branch. No lanes peel off the mainline. C1: Indicates a single-lane (MIS Ramp) branch off the mainline, with a fractional angle (18.4-degree) branch. No lanes peel off the mainline. D1: Indicates a single-lane (MIS Ramp) branch off the mainline, with an orthogonal branch. The branch is formed from one lane of the mainline, and the mainline has one fewer lane at the bottom. E1: Indicates a single-lane (MIS Ramp) branch off the mainline, with a diagonal branch. The branch is formed from one lane of the mainline, and the mainline has one fewer lane at the bottom. F1: Indicates a single-lane (MIS Ramp) branch off the mainline, splitting at a fractional angle (18.4-degree) from the mainline. The branch is formed from one lane of the mainline, and the mainline has one fewer lane at the bottom. A2: Indicates a dual-lane (RHW-4) branch off the mainline, with an orthogonal branch. One of the two lanes on the branch is from the mainline, and the mainline has one fewer lane at the bottom. B2: Indicates a dual-lane (RHW-4) branch off the mainline, with a diagonal branch. One of the two lanes on the branch is from the mainline, and the mainline has one fewer lane at the bottom. C2: Indicates a dual-lane (RHW-4) branch off the mainline, with a fractional angle (18.4-degree) branch. One of the two lanes on the branch is from the mainline, and the mainline has one fewer lane at the bottom. D2: Indicates a dual-lane (RHW-4) branch off the mainline, with an orthogonal branch. Both lanes on the branch are from the mainline, and the mainline has two fewer lanes at the bottom. E2: Indicates a dual-lane (RHW-4) branch off the mainline, with a diagonal branch. Both lanes on the branch are from the mainline, and the mainline has two fewer lanes at the bottom. F2: Indicates a dual-lane (RHW-4) branch off the mainline, with a fractional angle (18.4-degree) branch. Both lanes on the branch are from the mainline, and the mainline has two fewer lanes at the bottom. A3: Indicates a triple-lane (RHW-6S) branch off the mainline, with an orthogonal branch. Two of the three lanes on the branch is from the mainline, and the mainline has two fewer lanes at the bottom. B3: Indicates a triple-lane (RHW-6S) branch off the mainline, with a diagonal branch. Two of the three lanes on the branch is from the mainline, and the mainline has two fewer lanes at the bottom. There are currently no Type B3 ramps available. C3: Indicates a triple-lane (RHW-6S) branch off the mainline, with a fractional angle (18.4-degree) branch. Two of the three lanes on the branch is from the mainline, and the mainline has two fewer lanes at the bottom. D3: Indicates a triple-lane (RHW-6S) branch off the mainline, with an orthogonal branch. All three lanes on the branch are from the mainline, and the mainline has three fewer lanes at the bottom. E3: Indicates a triple-lane (RHW-6S) branch off the mainline, with a diagonal branch. All three lanes on the branch are from the mainline, and the mainline has three fewer lanes at the bottom. There are currently no Type E3 ramps available. F3: Indicates a triple-lane (RHW-6S) branch off the mainline, with a fractional angle (18.4-degree) branch. All three lanes on the branch are from the mainline, and the mainline has three fewer lanes at the bottom. There are currently no Type F3 ramps available. Below is a list of the modifiers:
Inside: This designation is seen on ramps from one-way RHW networks, and indicates that the ramp branch is on the inside (left exit/entrance in countries with right-hand traffic, right exit/entrance for those with left-hand traffic), rather than the expected outside. Wide: This designation indicates that the ramp branch has a larger separation than the standard version of that type, and is most commonly applied to A1 and A2 ramps. Wye: This designation indicates that both the branch and the mainline (often when the mainline is of the same width as the branch) both diverge from the path of the mainline at the top in a symmetrical fashion, forming a wishbone or Y-shape. Shift: This is an indication that the mainline undergoes curvature in the midst of the ramp. This occurs when the mainline shifts from an S-type network to a C-type network. Dual: This is an indication that there are two ramp branches on the ramp interface. This is most commonly seen with the bidirectional networks (RHW-2, RHW-3, and Double-Decker RHWs), or in conjunction with Shift. Folded: This is an indication that there are two ramp branches that curve off at 90-degree angles, in opposite directions. There is only one Folded ramp interface, the RHW-2 D1 Folded. Diagonal: This designation indicates that the mainline is diagonal rather than orthogonal. The branch angles are handled the same as if the ramp were orthogonal (i.e. an orthogonal ramp branch off a diagonal ramp interface would still be an A or D-type ramp of some sort). FA: This designation indicates that the mainline is at a fractional angle rather than orthogonal. The branch angles are handled the same as if the ramp were orthogonal (i.e. an orthogonal ramp branch off an FA ramp interface would still be an A or D-type ramp of some sort). Using FLEXRamps # FLEXRamps are ploppable FLEX on/offramp pieces, and are perhaps the easiest to navigate option to branch ramps off one\u0026rsquo;s RealHighway system. The FLEXRamp pieces may be found under the FLEXRamps button on the Highways menu. To use the FLEXRamps, simply find the desired ramp design, and plop it down. Each FLEXRamp has a default network, but will convert to match if one drags another RHW override network through it, or plops the ramp over an existing stretch of an RHW override network. The process is shown below (the process of overriding the base setup of the Draggable Ramp Interfaces is identical):
Due to the use of special network flags, FLEXRamps are relatively slope-tolerant, particularly compared to other ramp interface options.
Below is a list of the default networks for each FLEXRamp:
Ramp Default Network Type A1 RHW-2 Type B1 RHW-2 Type D1 RHW-3 Type E1 RHW-3 Type A2 RHW-6S Type B2 RHW-6S Type D2 RHW-6S Type E2 RHW-6S Type A3 RHW-8S Type D3 RHW-8S Type A1-Inside MIS Ramp Type B1-Inside MIS Ramp Type D1-Inside RHW-4 Type E1-Inside RHW-4 With the wider RHW networks (provided they are supported by the particular FLEXRamp type\u0026ndash;see the piece description in game), for most situations, simply align the ramp interface with the shoulder tile for standard ramps, and with the median tile for the inside ramps. If trying to build an RHW-8S Type D2 or E2 setup, however, one should instead align it with the median tile. (Note also that the elevated versions of the RHW-6S do not support Type A1 setups, and the elevated versions of the RHW-8S do not support Type A1 setups, due to the overhang on the RHW-6S network.)
Building Draggable Ramp Interfaces (DRIs) # Draggable Ramp Interfaces, or DRIs, are ramp interfaces that are constructed as Pattern-Based Draggables, using the RealHighway network. With the exception of a very few specialized setups, virtually every RHW ramp interface setup can be built through draggable means, and at present, there are some ramps that are only possible as DRIs. Each ramp interface type supported by the system has a special drag pattern, which, when constructed, will subsequently convert into the appropriate on/offramp.
The below Table of DRI Patterns shows the exit ramp (entrance ramp for Left-Hand Traffic) setup. The corresponding entrance (or exit in Left-Hand Traffic) can be constructed by using the mirror image of these patterns. The process for overriding a FLEXRamp to have another RHW network as a mainline is identical to that of the FLEXRamps, as shown above. Elevated ramp interfaces can be constructed by dragging the appropriate elevated RHW network (L1-L4) or double-decker RHW through the DRI, which, provided the particular setup is supported by that network, will elevate the ramp. Many setups for narrower networks can be transformed into corresponding versions for wider networks by using the same method. This conversion is most reliable if the overriding network is dragged into the top end of the mainline.
Since the drag patterns involve the creation of intersections, the point where the actual mainline/branch split occurs will result in flat terrain, but the rest of a DRI is not limited in this regard.
The table below shows all of the basic drag patterns for the DRIs:
Open image in new tab Older Puzzle Piece Ramp Interfaces # A set of Puzzle Piece Ramp Interfaces also exists. While it was the original method for constructing ramp interfaces, it has largely become a deprecated method, aside from the few setups not covered otherwise, due to the demands it places on the menu system. The Puzzle Piece Ramp Interfaces exist under two buttons, the Puzzle Piece Ramp Interfaces button, and the Fractional Angle Ramp Interfaces button (which contains all the Type C and Type F ramps). One must find the precise puzzle piece needed for the particular setup on the desired network, and place it. As static puzzle pieces, these ramp interfaces cannot carry overrides.
Most (but not all) of the Puzzle Piece Ramp Interfaces have starters attached on their mainline approaches and branches, which does allow one to use them without having to place additional starters, but the presence of these starters also severely limits their slope tolerance. As such, they can generally only be used on flat terrain, or they will end up flattening parts of slopes. If the puzzle-based interface does not have a starter stub on its ends (as it the case with most of the Fractional Angle types), one must place it after constructing the base network, and a portion of the ramp.
QuickChange: A Shortcut to Quicker Interchanges # In addition to the ramp interfaces, a series of \u0026ldquo;shortcuts\u0026rdquo; exist, in the form of the FLEX-based QuickChange (QC) pieces. The QuickChanges include a base ramp interface (Type A1 by default) with a height transition already attached, and provide quadrants for standard diamond and parclo (partial-cloverleaf) interchanges. To build a QuickChange setup, simply place the desired setup, and as needed, drag an override network through the mainline portion (or plop it over an existing override network), after which point it will change to match.
The QuickChange pieces may be found under the QuickChange button on the Highways menu.
QuickChange Button QuickChange still operates with the RealHighway\u0026rsquo;s modular design philosophy in mind, and as such, is possible to swap in a different ramp interface type for the default Type A1 (such as a Type D1), simply by plopping the other ramp interface over the existing one.
Tutorial: Simple Diamond Interchange with QuickChange # To build a diamond interchange with the QuickChanges, in which the L1 RHW-4 crosses over a Road, first begin with the L1 RHW-4 Starter Pieces, and drag out with the RealHighway network tool to continue the overrides. Then, drag the Road underneath. Following that, place four QuickChange L1 RHW Partial Diamond pieces encircling the Road. The L1 RHW-2 base mainline of the QuickChanges should covert to match the L1 RHW-4 (if L1 RHW-2 lingers, simply click around the vicinity of the unconverted sections with the RealHighway network tool to get them to cooperate). After this, use the RealHighway network tool to drag between the height transitions, right through the Road. This will form the intersections between the ramps and the Road, thereby completing the interchange.
This process can easily be adapted to other RHW networks, other surface street options (such as Avenues or Network Widening Mod networks), and to variants where the RHW is at ground level, and the surface street crosses over using one of the Draggable Elevated Road Viaducts.
Transitioning to Other Networks # There are three types of transitions that exist in the RealHighway plugin: Height Transitions, Width Transitions, and Other Network Transitions. The first two cover cases between two RealHighway networks, while the latter covers transitions to non-RealHighway networks, i.e. Maxis and Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks.
There are two methods of constructing Height Transitions, both of which involve ploppable items: the FLEX-based FLEXHeight system (found under the \u0026ldquo;FLEXHeight\u0026rdquo; button), and the conventional puzzle piece approach (found under the \u0026ldquo;Height Transitions\u0026rdquo; button, now a \u0026ldquo;legacy/deprecated\u0026rdquo; item). The FLEXHeight system is the more full-featured of the two, and vastly exceeds the capabilities of the older puzzle piece form.
RHW FLEXHeight Button RHW Height Transition Puzzle Pieces Button (Only installed if \u0026ldquo;Legacy Height Transitions\u0026rdquo; option is selected.) There are two subtypes of Height Transitions: \u0026ldquo;Ramp-Style\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;On-Slope\u0026rdquo;. The former is designed for use on (relatively) level ground, and uses a multi-tile rise to get the RealHighway up to the desired height, and presently exists in an orthogonal version, a (limited) diagonal version, and a (limited) curved version. The latter is for use on an embankment, and exists in an orthogonal version, and a (limited) diagonal form. In order to ensure proper placement on the OnSlope transitions, use of the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Hole Diggers and Raisers is recommended.
The standard FLEXHeight transitions (orthogonal, diagonal, and curved) default to the base RHW-2 network (producing an elevated version of the RHW-2, either L1 or L2 out the other end). If wishing to simply use the RHW-2 network, plopping the piece down is all that is needed. (The 180-degree MIS Ramp transition is MIS-only, however, and dragging an RHW-2 into it will produce either an L0 or L1 MIS Ramp, depending on the end.) If using an On-Slope version, only drag the RHW network up to the edge of the transition, NOT through, in order to preserve the embankment.
Ramp-Style Usage # On-Slope Usage # To override the base RHW-2 configuration of the FLEXHeight transitions, either Ramp-Style or On-Slope, simply drag the desired override network into either end, and it will convert to match. If any tiles refuse to convert, simply click over the first point where the override stops complying, and it should convert. Placing starters on both sides of the transition ensures maximum stability.
If using a multi-tile network, simply place multiple FLEXHeight transitions adjacent to one another, and drag each tile of the multi-tile network into the ends of the transition.
On the orthogonal and diagonal transitions, is also possible to transition between two different elevations (i.e. L1 and L2 instead of L0 and L1), simply by plugging the appropriate overrides into the ends.
Additionally, 3-Level and 4-Level Ramp-Style transitions can be built by overlapping the ends of multiple FLEXHeight 1-Level or 2-Level pieces. Note that this can only be done with networks that support the L3 and L4 elevation (the RHW-4, MIS Ramp, and RHW-6S).
The Width Transitions include the new FLEXWidth transition (FLEX-WT) system, as well as the older \u0026ldquo;legacy/deprecated\u0026rdquo; puzzle piece-based Width Transitions.
FLEXWidth Transitions (FLEX-WT) # With the FLEXWidth transitions, these work similarly to the FLEXHeight transitions. Simply drag the appropriate networks into each end of the transition, which will, as appropriate, convert it to match.
For the large \u0026ldquo;S-to-C\u0026rdquo; transitions, due to the design of the FLEX piece, asymmetrical setups are possible. All networks involved in the transition must be at the same height level, and with the exception of the RHW-2-to-4 and RHW-3-to-4 transitions, which are L0/ground-level only, all height levels are available for FLEXWidth transitions.
Puzzle Piece Width Transitions DEPRECATED # With the legacy puzzle piece-based Width Transitions, simply find the desired puzzle piece by using TAB/Shift-TAB to cycle through the options, and place it. Most Width Transitions already have starters on the ends\u0026ndash;note, however, that this fact significantly limits the slope tolerance of these transitions.
Transitions to Non-RHW Networks # Transitions to non-RealHighway networks are accomplished simply by dragging the RealHighway and non-RealHighway network to meet. If the setup is supported, the transition will override to match the involved networks.
A full list of supported transition setups can be found here, and a listing of items under the transition-related menu buttons can be found here.
Advanced Curves and FLEXFly # Wide-Radius Curves (WRCs) and Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) # The default draggable curves for the RealHighway networks are not exactly the smoothest or most realistic. The FLEX-based and draggable Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) and the Puzzle Piece-based Wide-Radius Curves (WRCs) allow one to change that, by providing smoother curves with wider radii than the defaults. Both the FLEX and puzzle pieces can be found under the RealHighway Curves button on the Highways menu.
RHW Curves Button Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) [FLEX/Draggable] # The Multi-Radius Curves are a series of wider-radius curves that are constructed through either draggable means or with FLEX pieces. There are five radii total included in the MRC system\u0026ndash;R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5, as well as an S-Curve and a Basketweave setup. The higher the number, the wider the radius (i.e. R2 has a wider radius than R1). As with many items, they default to the RHW-2, but they can support up to the RHW-6S width\u0026ndash;more details as to precisely what is supported can be found here.
R1 curves, also known as \u0026ldquo;Mini-Curves\u0026rdquo;, are constructed by draggable means, and can be easily constructed with a simple additional motion when building the default network curves. Simply drag in a straight, orthogonal motion through the entire default curve. Afterward, a smoother curve will appear. Alternatively, one can simply try to drag the curve to the diagonal one tile before an end stub, which will also trigger the R1 curve.
Note that with the RHW-6S, due to the overhang, a \u0026ldquo;bite\u0026rdquo; may appear to be missing from some curve setups. Simply click in the area of the missing \u0026ldquo;bite\u0026rdquo; with the RealHighway network tool to fill it.
R2 45° curves may be constructed either via draggable means or FLEX pieces. For the draggable R2 setup, drag the default curve as usual, and then build a 90° bend on the inside of the curve, at which point it should convert. To build the FLEX piece, simply select it from the menu and place it. The FLEX pieces\u0026ndash;which include a 90° variant in addition to the 45° version\u0026ndash;all default to the base L0 RHW-2 network, but dragging an override network into a FLEX MRC piece, or plopping one over top of an existing stretch of override network will cause it to convert to match, provided the network is supported for that particular setup.
Note also that the orthogonal ends of R2 curves can, in fact, overlap, allowing for one to create a smooth composite curve, which can be very useful in building aesthetically-pleasing interchange ramps.
The R3, R4, and R5 radii only exist as FLEX pieces, and can be constructed the same way as the R2 FLEX piece. They do not, however, support the overlap/composite curve functionality of the R2 curves.
The Multi-Radius Curves do not support the creation of intersections or crossings at any point in the curve, and attempting to build one will destabilize the curve. The FLEXFly system does allow for an equivalent functionality, however.
Wide-Radius Curves (WRCs) [Puzzle] # In addition to the MRCs, a series of puzzle piece-based Wide-Radius Curves (WRCs) also exists, which at least partially cover all ground-level RealHighway networks. S-Curves exist for all networks, 45° curves exist for all but the RHW-6C and 8C, and 90° curves (in two radii\u0026ndash;small and large) exist for the RHW-2 and MIS Ramps.
The Wide-Radius Curve puzzle pieces do NOT have starters on their ends, unlike many other older puzzle-based RealHighway items, and being puzzle-based, do not support overrides. As such, they generally must be built on top of an existing stretch of a RealHighway network. The network must already exist up to the point at which the curve piece begins. With S-Curves/Lane Shifts, the presence of base network stubs may allow one to simply place starters oneself on either end.
The S-Curves for the RHW-6C and RHW-8C are built in a modular fashion as well, to allow support for the asymmetrical \u0026ldquo;RHW-7C\u0026rdquo; setup. Simply build the full curve one half at a time.
It is possible to also build larger composite 90° turns with the single-tile networks, using the RHW Filler Pieces, but this functionality does not exist for the RHW-8S, 10S, 6C, or 8C.
Using the FLEXFly (Flexible Flyover) System # The FLEXFly (Flexible Flyover) pieces are FLEX-based curved flyover ramps, which can be crossed under or over by almost every RealHighway network (except for the L0 RHW-2, for the purposes of stability). They can be found under the FLEXFly button on the Highways menu.
RHW FLEXFly Button The FLEXFly pieces come in two angles\u0026ndash;90° and 45°\u0026ndash;and both single-lane/MIS Ramp-based or dual-lane/RHW-4-based versions are available, at height levels from L0 to L2. Their curve radii are equivalent to the R2 Multi-Radius Curves.
To use a FLEXFly piece, first place the desired setup. Each FLEXFly will allow draggable orthogonal crossings at any point in the curve, provided the crossing network is at different height level than the FLEXFly itself. To create these crossings, just drag the network under/over the FLEXFly. To continue the flyover ramp, just drag out from the ends of the FLEXFly, just as if it were a starter piece, or connect it to other RealHighway-related items (like height transitions) as desired.
Note that FLEXFly pieces can only support a single crossing network at any given point. In certain situations, such as the first one (with the green checkmark), it is actually possible to cross one FLEXFly over another FLEXFly, though this is strictly limited. Attempting to build unsupported overlaps, or crossing two networks under one tile of FLEXFly will yield glitched or blank network tiles, as seen in the other three images (with the red circle-and-slash). Additionally, FLEXFly pieces do not support the overlap/composite technique of the R2 Multi-Radius Curves.
Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Fractional Angle RealHighways (FARHW) # Note that the current iteration of FARHW is considered \u0026ldquo;legacy\u0026rdquo; in the current NAM development paradigm as it is currently only usable via puzzle pieces. This will change in future releases.
One can also further their \u0026ldquo;grid-busting\u0026rdquo; efforts with the RealHighway system with the use of the Fractional Angle RealHighway (FARHW) Puzzle Pieces. The FARHW pieces allow one to build RealHighways at angles other than orthogonal and diagonal\u0026ndash;currently, only 18.4°/71.6° (or \u0026ldquo;FA-3\u0026rdquo;, as it is known in Fractional Angle Network nomenclature).
The FARHW pieces exist under three different buttons\u0026ndash;the main FARHW pieces button, which contains the base fractional angle network pieces, and curves to connect to orthogonal and diagonal networks, the FARHW Ramp Interfaces button, which contain ramp interfaces involving FARHW connections (including the Type C1, C2, F1, F2, and C3 ramps), and the FARHW Intersections and Transitions button, which contains intersection pieces with FARHW approaches, as well as width transitions between different FARHW widths.
FARHW Button FARHW Ramp Interfaces Button FARHW Intersections and Transitions Button In building stretches of FARHW, make sure that the line colors (or shoulder widths, if dealing with Euro textures) line up properly.
Note that, with the exception of the FARHW Ramp Interfaces, none of the other FARHW pieces have starters on their ends, much like the Wide-Radius Curves, so one must be sure to place the orthogonal or diagonal ends of curves over an existing stretch of network.
Cosmetic Pieces # The Cosmetic Pieces are a set of puzzle pieces that are designed to allow one to exercise finer control of the look of their RealHighways, particularly with lane markings, such as auxiliary lane and HOV lane markings. Due to their sheer number (166 total at present), the Cosmetic Pieces are divided under four separate buttons, one for each tile width possibility (1-tile, 2-tile, and 3-tile), and one for cosmetic transitions. All four buttons can be found under the Highways menu.
RHW 1-Tile Cosmetic Pieces Button RHW 2-Tile Cosmetic Pieces Button RHW 3-Tile Cosmetic Pieces Button RHW Cosmetic Transitions Button To use the Cosmetic Pieces, simply find the desired piece and place it. Please note that as puzzle pieces, the Cosmetic Pieces cannot accept or pass along overrides, albeit they can be placed over starter pieces in many situations.
Bridges # The NAM does include bridges for various RealHighway networks. However, it is worth noting that there are some special caveats, due to a hardcoded restriction in the game\u0026rsquo;s terrain engine, which prevents bridges from being built without at least a one-tile separation between them:
Bridges involving the wider S-type networks (RHW-8S and RHW-10S) must be built with the Maxis Ground Highway tool instead of the RealHighway tool. Bridges involving the wider C-type networks (RHW-6C and RHW-8C) are not possible. There are bridges available for adjacent RHW-4 and RHW-6S situations, also built with the Maxis Ground Highway tool. Bridges for RealHighway networks with separate carriageways (i.e. the MIS Ramps, RHW-4, RHW-6S, RHW-8S, RHW-10S, and DDRHW-4) will have their traffic flow determined by the way in which the base network is dragged. Take note of the preview models to ensure you have built the bridge in the correct direction. For the bridges that use the Maxis Highway as a base, there are overrides in place to seamlessly connect with the otherwise RealHighway-based networks. In order to create this smooth transition, ensure that only the end stub of the Maxis Highway network is showing at each end of the bridge. Then, simply drag each tile of the RealHighway override network into the Maxis Highway stubs. They will convert to match the RealHighway. This process is shown below.
Below is a list of all the bridges presently available. Maxis Ground Highway-based bridges will be marked with a bracketed note. (Click images for full resolution.)

You will need to switch to 2xRHW-6S before crossing rivers, use one of the 6C-to-6S transition pieces.
RHW-8C Bridges # Not possible due to terrain engine restriction. You will need to switch to 2xRHW-8S before crossing rivers, use one of the 8C-to-8S transition pieces.
Tunnels # The base RealHighway network does NOT support tunnels. While certain slope settings may permit a tunnel to appear, it will be completely non-functional, due to hardcoded limitations that prevent traffic from using it. There is no known solution to this limitation at present. The only possible workaround at present is to transition to another network that does support tunnels, or to use the new FLEX/Draggable version of the Flexible Underpasses and URoads.
Neighbor Connections # While the single-tile, two-way RealHighway networks (the RHW-2, RHW-3, and DDRHW-4) can form functioning neighbor connections the standard way, attempting to do this with any other RealHighway network will result in only freight trucks being able to use the connection. This is because the game cannot handle one-way neighbor connections, as would be required with the RHW-4, MIS, and the various wider networks. As a result, special Neighbor Connectors (NCs) are required, in order to provide proper functionality for these override networks. These can be found under the RHW Neighbor Connector Pieces button.
RHW Neighbor Connector Pieces Button There are two types of pieces involved in RHW Neighbor Connections: Network Pieces and Invisible Loop Connectors.
To build the Neighbor Connection, build a standard Neighbor Connection through the normal draggable means with the network you wish to use.
Please note that no matter how you drag the RHW to the edge, the default yellow Neighbor Connection will always be facing the same way, unlike Avenue or Maxis Highway Neighbor Connections. (There is no way to change this, nor any need to do so.)
Then find the RHW Neighbor Connector button, and place the FLEX Neighbor Connector (FLEX-NC) over each network tile that will be part of the Neighbor Connection, on the the game\u0026rsquo;s default yellow Neighbor Connection arrows. After that, simply drag the network through the FLEX-NC to connect it.
If the two sides of your RHW are separated by one or more tiles, place the Invisible Loop Connectors in the median area right next to the edge of the city tile, filling the gap. The Invisible Loop Connectors, which look like a blue arrow with an \u0026ldquo;N\u0026rdquo; inside, when placed, will show up invisible, but you can easily locate them by hovering a query tool over top, which will cause an otherwise invisible \u0026ldquo;ghost model\u0026rdquo; with the blue \u0026ldquo;N\u0026rdquo; arrow to appear:
Do not place the Invisible Loop Connectors directly over top of you network, as this is not what they were intended for and they will actually prevent your system from working. Due to how the pieces have to be set up, it is also possible you will see \u0026ldquo;spider cars\u0026rdquo; going down the edge of your city tile, and the paths will be draped over the edge of the city tile.
For \u0026ldquo;Combined\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;C-type\u0026rdquo;) networks, such as the RHW-6C and 8C, simply place the FLEX-NC over top of the network at the edge of the city tile, and then drag the RHW-C network through it.
In order for the connection to work properly, this process must be repeated identically in the neighboring city tile, and the traffic simulation must be given some time to run in both involved city tiles in order for the game to recognize that there is a valid connection.
NOTE: With the addition of the FLEX Neighbor Connectors in NAM 42, all elevated networks are now supported.
Specialised Network Crossings and Interchanges # The RealHighway system includes the ability to recreate three oft-requested interchange designs: the Single-Point Urban Interchange (SPUI), the Diverging Diamond Interchange (DDI), and the Volleyball Interchange. These are \u0026ldquo;advanced\u0026rdquo; features of the plugin, and it is recommended that you are already comfortable with the RealHighways, the NAM Elevated Viaducts and the either the FLEX Turn Lanes (FTL) or Turn Lane Extension Pieces (TuLEPs) before trying to build SPUIs or DDIs.
The SPUI and DDI setups can be found under the RHW/Avenue Interface button on the Roads menu, while the Volleyball pieces can be found under the old puzzle-based Ramps button on the Highways menu.

The SPUI and DDI setups can be found under the RHW/Avenue Interface button on the Roads menu, while the Volleyball pieces can be found under the old puzzle-based Ramps button on the Highways menu.
NOTE: FlexSPUI was upgraded and redesigned for NAM 37, to provide proper support for newer RHW networks. The screenshots here show the previous version of FlexSPUI, which has a slightly different footprint, but the underlying construction process is identical.
In order to build a SPUI, place the FlexSPUI piece\u0026ndash;it looks like half of a SPUI.
To complete the basic intersection, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to plop another half of a SPUI. This half can be plopped next to the first one:
Or you can put a small gap between them and fill it in with an Avenue:
In either case, make sure to bulldoze the \u0026ldquo;construction site handles\u0026rdquo; on the piece. The ramp connections on the sides allow RHW-4 to be dragged out from them:
You can simply drag an elevated RHW over top of the FlexSPUI, like so:
In order to connect the Avenue end, use the either the Avenue Type 110 FLEX Turn Lanes or Turn Lane Extension Pieces:
It is also possible to elevate the FlexSPUI. Simply place an L2 connection (such as a transition) next to the ramp connection on the SPUI (NOTE: L1 did not exist when FlexSPUI was created). Most of one half of it will become elevated\u0026ndash;simply click on the non-elevated part with the RHW network tool and it will raise up:
The overrides are most stable on the \u0026ldquo;incoming\u0026rdquo; part of the ramp connection (\u0026ldquo;outgoing\u0026rdquo; in Left-Hand Drive)\u0026ndash;this shows the rest of the SPUI becoming elevated:
You can simply drag a ground-level RHW underneath the Elevated FlexSPUI, much as you dragged the Elevated RHW over the Ground FlexSPUI:
In order to connect the Avenue end, you will need to use the Avenue Type A On-Slope TuLEP. The NAM\u0026rsquo;s Hole Digger and Raiser feature is highly recommended in order to get the embankment to the proper elevation.
For a video demonstration of FlexSPUI construction, please see Tarkus\u0026rsquo; YouTube videos on Ground FlexSPUI and Elevated FlexSPUI.
Diverging Diamond Interchange (DDI) # The Diverging Diamond Interchange (DDI), sometimes also called \u0026ldquo;Crossing Diamond\u0026rdquo;, is an interchange that originated in France, but has recently caught on with North American highway engineers, through the work of American traffic engineer Gilbert Chlewicki. The Missouri Department of Transportation (MODOT) opened the first in the United States in Springfield on June 21, 2009. Since then, many more have opened up across the world. The DDI involves having traffic cross onto the \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; side of the road, which allows left turn movements flow more smoothly and traffic onto (and sometimes off) the freeway to go unsignalized, with only the through movements on the surface street requiring signalization.
The RHW includes a special puzzle piece allowing for the construction of a DDI with an Avenue, which, like the FlexSPUI, is found under the RHW x Avenue button on the Roads menu. To build a DDI, place the special DDI intersection pieces on either side of your RHW, and connect Avenues into the appropriate ends of the pieces. Use One-Way Roads and/or the draggable or puzzle piece-based Elevated One-Way Road Viaducts (for an elevated DDI) to build the \u0026ldquo;wrong side\u0026rdquo; traffic sections between the DDI intersection pieces. The connections to the RHW end are made via RHW-4.
Volleyball Interchange # The Volleyball Interchange, also commonly known as a Three-Level Diamond, or Split-Level Diamond, is a three-level interchange, in which all turning motions are handled by at-grade intersections on a separate height level from through traffic.
Under the old Puzzle Piece Ramp Interfaces button on the Highways menu, one can find a series of \u0026ldquo;Specialized Crossing Pieces\u0026rdquo; (SCPs) to handle Volleyball Interchange intersections. To use them, simply place them down, and place starter pieces between each intersection to connect them.
Three-Level Crossings # In certain situations, using special Three-Level Crossing helper pieces (located under the RHW 3-Level Crossings button), it is possible to have three different RHW elevations cross one another on a single tile, which can be useful in constructing more complex interchanges, such as compact T-Interchanges and Stack Interchanges. To use the Three-Level Crossings, connect two different height levels of diagonal network, and the desired width of mainline at a third height level. It is recommended to use the 2-Tile version for the RHW-4 and RHW-6S, the 3-Tile version for the RHW-6C and RHW-8C, and the 4-Tile version for the RHW-8S and RHW-10S.
Note that any FLEXFly or curve pieces must be at least 1 tile away from a Three-Level Crossing FLEX Piece, as at present, the adjacency stability does not exist, nor does FLEXFly-over-FLEXFly functionality.
The \u0026ldquo;Stackasaurus Rex\u0026rdquo; Interchange, built by NAM Team developer Lucario Boricua, is an example of what is possible with the Three-Level Crossings.
RHW FLEX Turn Lanes (FTLs) # The RHW has its own set of (rapidly-expanding) FLEX Turn Lane (FTL) options available. Supported types include the RHW-2 (L0 only), RHW-4 Rural (L0 only), and MIS Ramps (L0 and L1). Support for SITAP-style signalized intersections is also available in at least some instances.
To build the RHW-2 FTLs, begin with the transition, and drag RHW-2 out from it. The override of the turn lane will carry until you reach an intersection with another network.
The override does not continue on the other side of the intersection, if a +-intersection is made, so one must place another transition and build the same setup on the other side.
It is possible to signalize intersections with Roads and other RHW-2s, via two methods: the first involves transitioning to Road immediately before the intersection (as is the case with the draggable signalized One-Way Road intersections in SITAP).
The second involves using one of the RHW FLEX SITAP intersections in the back half of the RHW FLEX Turn Lanes TAB Loop, placing it, and then reconnecting all the networks.
In the case of T-intersections, in which the RHW-2 is the thru network, use the T-Median transition on the opposite side.
Currently, the only crossing networks supported by the RHW-2 FTLs are Streets, Roads (with and without SITAP), and other RHW-2s (both with and without FTLs, and with and without SITAP).
To build rural-style RHW-4 FTLs, use the same transition as the RHW-2 FTLs, but override it with the RHW-4 network to convert it.
Situations in which the RHW-4 FTLs are adjacent (or separated only by a single tile median) are possible. (Note that the Rural RHW-4 FTLs are presently the least-developed of the set, and may have instabilities, particularly involving more exotic T-intersections.)
Currently, the only crossing networks supported by the Rural RHW-4 FTLs are Streets (+ and limited T), Roads (with and without SITAP, + and limited T), and RHW-2 (without FTLs, and with or without SITAP, + and limited T).
The MIS FTLs, known in their 2-lane form as \u0026ldquo;MIS-2\u0026rdquo;, currently come in two flavors: one that favors right turns, and the other that favors left turns. Each produces a different end result at a Road +-intersection (with SITAP support).
It is also possible to hook an RHW-4 into an MIS FTL, in which case the RHW-4 seamlessly transitions into an MIS-2 FTL.
Additionally, combination FLEX Height/Turn Lane transitions exist, allowing more flexibility when adding turn lanes to ramps in interchanges.
Currently, the only crossing networks supported by the MIS-2 FTLs are Roads (with and without SITAP, + and T), One-Way Roads (with SITAP, + and T), Avenues (with and without SITAP, + and T), Type 110 Road/NWM FTLs (with and without SITAP, +-only), Type 120 Avenue/NWM FTLs (with and without SITAP, +-only), Type 130 NWM FTLs (with and without SITAP, +-only), L1 Road (with and without SITAP, + and T), L1 Avenue (without SITAP, +-only), and two intersection types currently only used by the QuickChange Xpress interchanges: Dual Type 110 Road/NWM FTLs, and Dual Type 120 Avenue/NWM FTLs.

This mod utilizes a workaround to display RHWs on the Regional Transport Map. It also contains an updated and expanded map legend to reflect the new network colors as well as the addition of Monorail as a separate color from El-Rail/GLR. This mod is NOT compatible with any other Regional Transport Map mods.
There is one requirement for the mod to function correctly: You MUST activate at least one dataview in game before saving for the game to render the map correctly. It does not appear that this issue can be fixed.
After installation, each city tile must be opened and saved (after opening any dataview) in order to update the region map. Similarly when uninstalling the mod, each city tile must be resaved to update the region map.
Frequently Asked Questions # Q: Why are highways black instead of red?
A: Because of the way this workaround functions, the red color would show up as a halo around diagonal roads, bridges and certain puzzle pieces. The black color does as well, but is less noticeable.
Q: Why do the diagonals look weird?
A: Again, because of the way this workaround functions, the diagonal roads, avenues and streets show up intermingled with the highway color. This is not possible to fix but the map colors were chosen to make it less noticable than other color combinations.
Q: Why are all my roads black?
A: If you do not open any of the dataviews before saving the game, the map will be rendered incorrectly resulting in all car traffic networks showing up as the highway color.
Q: Will you make a version with my favorite colors?
A: Sorry, but no. Anyone who can use iLive\u0026rsquo;s Reader can easily change the colors to their liking.
Other Known Issues # Placing FLEX On-Slope Transitions immediately next to crossing points, without a one-tile gap before the crossing, can destabilize the overrides and prevent the crossing from working properly. Information on Support and Development Updates # For technical support and information on new features coming to the RealHighway system in future releases, please check out the official RealHighway (RHW) - Development and Support threads on the forums at SimCity 4 Devotion and Simtropolis.

Network and FLEX Piece Capabilities # Key # Yes This particular feature can be constructed, with minimal (if any) limitations. Partial Support This particular feature can be constructed, but not in all instances. Details will be given as to what is/is not possible. Partial support may be for intentional design reasons (such as realism or general unfeasibility), or simply because the feature has not been fully developed. Limited Support This particular feature can be constructed, but only in extremely limited circumstances. Instances that are possible may be listed, insofar as it is possible. Use at your own risk. No Support This particular feature cannot be constructed. This restriction could be for intentional design reasons (such as realism, general unfeasibility, or game limitations), or simply because it has not yet been developed. Additional Notes # OxO: OxO stands for \u0026ldquo;orthogonal x orthogonal\u0026rdquo;, and refers to a situation where both networks are orthogonal (in a straight line) along the game\u0026rsquo;s grid, intersecting perpendicularly (at 90° angles at all corners).
OxD: OxD stands for \u0026ldquo;orthogonal x diagonal\u0026rdquo;, and refers to a situation where the given network is orthogonal (in a straight line) along the game\u0026rsquo;s grid, and the cross network is diagonal (running at a 45° angle).
DxO: DxO stands for \u0026ldquo;diagonal x orthogonal\u0026rdquo;, and refers to a situation where the base network is diagonal (running at a 45° angle), and the cross network is orthogonal (in a straight line) along the game\u0026rsquo;s grid.
DxD: DxD stands for \u0026ldquo;diagonal x diagonal\u0026rdquo;, and refers to a situation where both networks are diagonal (running at a 45° angle) along the game\u0026rsquo;s grid, intersecting perpendicularly (at 90° angles at all corners).

The draggable functionality supports overpasses of virtually every network and network family in the NAM, often in all possible orientations, and the legacy puzzle piece functionality remains available as well. Basic, easy-to-use, single-plop FLEX-based Overpasses also exist as part of the system.
For information on the Rail equivalent, see the RealRailway Feature Guide.
Installing the Elevated Road Viaducts # By default, all the boxes for the Elevated Road Viaducts are checked. The main Elevated Viaducts box installs the Draggable Elevated Road Viaducts. The Legacy Road Viaduct Puzzle Piece Menu Access box allows one to install the menu buttons to access the puzzle piece form of the Elevated Road Viaducts\u0026ndash;note that unchecking this box will not cause existing puzzle-based Road Viaducts in one\u0026rsquo;s cities to disappear; it simply removes the menu buttons, leaving less to navigate on the Roads menu. Finally, the Viaduct Additions box installs the Alternate Viaduct Additions, some aesthetic alternate styles of Road (and Street) Viaducts, with very limited OxO-only overcrossing capabilities.
FLEX Overpass Functionality # Under the FLEX Overpasses Button on the Roads menu, one will find three separate entries: one for Road Overpasses, one for One-Way Road, and one for Avenue.
Using TAB and Shift-TAB (Ctrl-TAB and Ctrl-Shift-TAB on Mac) with the menu button selected will allow one to cycle through the three networks, while Home and End will rotate and lengthen/shorten the overpasses (from 1 to 4 tiles in length), to allow different widths of networks (or combinations of networks) sufficient room to cross underneath (resulting in a total of 12 overpass configurations from the 3 TAB loop entries). All FLEX Overpasses are at L1 (7.5-meter) elevation.
Open image in new tab Open image in new tab To build an overpass, simply plop the desired overpass, and then drag any networks you\u0026rsquo;d like to cross over underneath the middle section, between the two height transition ramps. Dragging the base network out the ground ends or through the overpass will allow one to continue the ground level network, and dragging through the overpass with the One-Way Road network will set the direction of any One-Way Road overpasses. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s that easy!
Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Base and Override Networks # The base set of Elevated Road Viaducts includes six (6) override networks: Level 1 (L1, 7.5 meters high) and Level 2 (L2, 15 meters high) versions of the games base Road, One-Way Road (OWR), and Avenue networks. Aside from being elevated off the ground, the rest of the network properties (including capacity) remain in tact. The menu button, which contains the starters and height transitions, can be found on the Roads menu.
To build an Elevated Road Viaduct through draggable means, simply place down the appropriate starter, drag the network through the starter (Road for Road Viaducts, One-Way Road for One-Way Road Viaducts, and Avenue for Avenue Viaducts), and release, upon which the ground network will convert to its elevated form.
Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Transitions # There are two methods to connect to the draggable Elevated Road Viaducts from ground level\u0026ndash;the standard Height Transition, and the On-Slope Transition.
With the standard Height Transition, simply place the transition, drag the network out of both sides, and release\u0026ndash;the elevated side will convert to a viaduct, while the ground level side will remain at ground level.
Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab With the On-Slope Transitions, which may initially appear to be a RealHighway upon placement, place them on the appropriate embankment (the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Hole Diggers/Raisers can help) simply drag the appropriate ground-level network up to the tile just before the On-Slope transition, and it will convert to match. If using Avenue, build two side-by-side On-Slopes. To continue the viaduct, simply start this process again on the other side.
Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Open image in new tab Crossings and Intersections # With most Elevated Road Viaducts crossings, all you need to do is simply drag the crossing network perpendicularly across the viaduct, or vice-versa. This works with overpasses, underpasses and elevated at-grade intersections.
Overpasses
Elevated At-Grade Intersections
Note: Some items, like Tram Dual-Networking items, Hybrid Railway, and Maxis Highways, may require you to stop the viaduct before the crossing network, and then resume from a stub on the other side, due to the nature of those network items. Legacy Puzzle Pieces # A series of legacy puzzle pieces exists for the Elevated Road Viaducts as well. Static versions of the overpasses exist, along with sets of puzzle pieces for L1 and L2 Road, L2 One-Way Road (there are no L1 One-Way Road puzzle pieces, nor will they be developed), and L1 and L2 Avenue. The only items that are not yet covered by the newer draggable system are the Diagonal On-Slope Transitions, and Maxis Highway crossings may be more flexible with the puzzle pieces at this time. FLEX versions of these will be added in a future release, rendering this set completely deprecated.

This process is shown below.

(The Diagonal Street Fillers, as static puzzle pieces, cannot carry overrides.) The process is shown below.
Open image in new tab All SAM Sets, with the exception of SAM 1, can also override the NAM\u0026rsquo;s Draggable Wide-Radius Curves for the Street network, simply by dragging the SAM network up to the edge of the curve, or drawing the pattern while continuing a SAM override. This process is shown below:
Open image in new tab For quick reference, the patterns for the Draggable Wide-Radius Curves for the Street network are shown below:
Open image in new tab All networks, including SAM 1, also support the default sharp 90° bend.
(Older, static puzzle piece curves for some SAM sets can also be found in the Rural Roads Plugin (RuRP), and will be found under the Rural Roads button on the Roads menu.)
Intersecting and Transitioning to Other Networks # Intersections and Transitions with Other Networks
With supported networks\u0026ndash;including Roads, One-Way Roads, Avenues, and Rails (including all Rail-based override networks*)\u0026ndash;intersections and crossings can simply be built by dragging the overridden Street network through the network, just as one would with any other draggable network. Supported networks allow for crossings in all possible permutations of orthogonal and diagonal networks. (The High Speed Rail override network also allows orthogonal x orthogonal crossings of select SAM networks via static puzzle pieces.)
Open image in new tab In addition, it is possible to transition to the Road, One-Way Road, or Avenue network by simply dragging to connect one of these networks to the SAM Network.
SAM Set 1 (the Parking Lots) are a special case. They can intersect or transition to other networks in a clean visual manner due to how they dovetail with the base Street network, but technically cannot form intersections or transitions. The overrides will not continue beyond the intersection, unlike what occurs with all the other SAM networks.
SAM Interaction with the Street Network
SAM Overrides are pervasive. The presence of a SAM Starter Piece will cause all Streets with exposure to the SAM Street\u0026ndash;including those that intersect it\u0026ndash;to also be overridden. As such, it is not possible to create an intersection between a SAM Street and a Maxis Street, or between two different SAM types.
Open image in new tab Transitions between two SAM Sets, or between SAM Streets and standard Streets are possible using the dedicated FLEX Piece, or by quickly transitioning from SAM -\u0026gt; Road -\u0026gt; Street, which breaks the override, though care should be taken even in these cases. Attempting to drag two SAM Sets into one another without the FLEX Transition or another intervening network will simply result in a \u0026ldquo;tug-of-war\u0026rdquo; between the two sets, which can have unpredictable and unstable results.
*(Rail-based override networks include Single-Track Rail (STR) in both Maxis Rail and RealRailway (RRW) forms, plus the L1 and L2 Draggable Elevated RealRailway Viaducts.)
Bridges # Select SAM sets include bridge support. To access the SAM\u0026rsquo;s bridge options, one should simply drag the Street network across the body of water (or deep canyon) wishes to cross, at which point the SAM bridges will show up among the Street options.
Tunnels # The base Street network does NOT support tunnels, and accordingly, neither do any of the SAM\u0026rsquo;s Street-based override networks. While certain slope settings may permit a tunnel to appear, it will be completely non-functional, due to hardcoded limitations that prevent traffic from using it. There is no known solution to this limitation at present. The only possible workaround at present is to transition to another network that does support tunnels.
Network Capabilities # See the Network Widening Mod Technical Specs Section.
Known Issues # Attempting to intersect a SAM override network with another NAM override network that does not support SAM crossings may de-stabilize both overrides, causing them to alternate which override is broken with clickaround. Attempting to intersect two SAM types, or transition directly between them will cause override instability. Use the FLEX Transitions or another intervening network (i.e. Road). Attempting to build multiple Draggable Wide-Radius Curves and/or intersections directly adjacent to one another may break SAM overrides, causing reversion to Street.

`}),e.add({id:42,href:"/docs/feature-guides/the-nam-traffic-simulator/",title:"The NAM Traffic Simulator",description:"The NAM Traffic Simulator is a traffic simulator that is derived from the original Maxis traffic simulator, but is also built upon the knowledge gained from all previous NAM traffic simulators, including work by the7trumpets, Tropod, jplumbley, mott, and z.",content:`Areas of Work # One of the main areas of the work on the NAM Traffic Simulator involved increasing the efficiency of the pathfinder to close to its theoretical maximum. One of the main ways this was initially accomplished was by using a much more accurate version of the pathfinding heuristic than had been available in previous traffic simulators. Also, the Sims\u0026rsquo; maximum commute time was increased to give them enough time to get to work. These changes allow a smoother distribution of traffic throughout the city, with typically less congestion. At the same time, the congestion that does exist no longer leads to abandonment due to commute time in well-built cities; Sims know that they occasionally have to sit through traffic jams, and are a bit more patient. Better pathfinding also means that Sims act much smarter about finding jobs and routes to them; this also results in less abandonment due to commute time. As in the real world, zones can be farther apart without causing problems; this is especially helpful when building existing cities to scale, which can now be done reliably. Finally, running the pathfinder with near-optimum settings allows the simulator to run up to several times as fast as previous traffic simulators.
The second major area of work on the original Simulator Z involved a more flexible distribution of traffic among the various travel types. In combination with the pathfinder upgrading, this allows buses to be counted toward traffic and congestion, just like all other vehicles. This is a significant change from all previous simulators, and it\u0026rsquo;s an important point to remember when planning your transportation infrastructure. More flexible distribution of traffic also means that the NAM Traffic Simulator is much more dynamic about allowing Sims to choose their transportation. In cities with excellent highways and road capacity, car usage has been measured at over six times that of previous simulators. Yet for cities with less extensive road networks and reasonable mass transit, car usage is actually less than in previous traffic simulators.
Simulator Changes # Version 3.0 of the NAM Traffic Simulator contains the following changes from the previous version of the simulator: # Multiple parameters in the traffic simulator that affect pathfinding were tuned in order to greatly improve pathfinding. As the pathfinder is at the heart of the traffic simulator, this tuning made the other changes in this section possible. Early on in the development of version 3.0 of the traffic simulator, it was discovered that one of the most powerful ways of optimizing the pathfinder used congestion patterns and the associated traffic speed decreases to reroute traffic to less congested (and therefore faster) routes. This was done by modifying the pathfinder\u0026rsquo;s Congestion vs. Speed curve to be more aggressive. The Congestion vs. Speed (CvS) curve is used to determine how much speed decrease is associated with each degree of congestion. There are actually two slightly different Congestion vs. Speed curves used in this version of the traffic simulator. The first works best where there is at least some congestion present, and this one is included in the Classic and Low capacity versions of the simulator. The second version of this curve works equally well at all capacity levels of the simulator. However, since the first version of the CvS curve works significantly better than the second version for low capacity simulators, the second version is used only for the Medium, High, and Ultra versions of the simulator, since these capacity levels typically have little or no congestion, and the first version of the CvS curve would perform worse than the second under these circumstances. This has the following consequences: Since the first version of the CvS curve results in the best pathfinding performance in the two low capacity simulators where it can be used (Classic and Low), the Low capacity simulator is recommended for most cities. All capacity levels of the simulator result in noticebly reduced congestion compared to previous versions of the simulator used in identical cities. Specifically, when using the Low capacity simulator, typically only scattered congestion appears until a city passes a population of about 1.5 million Sims, and the congestion becomes serious around the level of 2 million Sims. However, as long as a city\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure is maintained appropriately for its population, the Low capacity can be used to support cities just as big as those supported by the Ultra capacity simulator, although cities may need additional transit infrastructure (most notably, subways) if the Low capacity simulator is used on large cities. Similarly, the Classic capacity simulator, which has half the capacities of the Low capacity simulator, starts showing congestion well before the Low capacity simulator, but can still be used to support cities of arbitrary size. As a test, the Classic capacity simulator was used to develop a city from scratch to a total of 4.129 million Sims. This city ran fine, with a mayor rating of 99, which is the same mayor rating that all the other capacity simulators produced. With different zoning, the Classic capacity simulator could easily have supported at least 5 million Sims in a healthy city. At these population levels with the low capacity simulators, though, there is massive congestion. With improved pathfinding, Sims make much better use of all transportation modes, especially with the Classic and Low capacity simulators. Specifically, usage of light rail (which includes el rail and ground light rail (GLR), or trams) used to be unreasonably low, right up to the previous version of the traffic simulator. With well-built light rail systems, usage is now much higher, often by two orders of magnitude. Lesser improvements also occur in the usage of other forms of rapid transit. The end result is that rapid transit of all types now has usage patterns much closer to the theoretically ideal ones. Version 3.0 of the NAM Traffic Simulator provides the first significant improvement in intercity traffic since early versions of Simulator Z. This improvement is most pronounced in the Classic and Low capacity simulators. Both versions of the CvS curve provide a significant traffic spreading effect, which is the result of the simulator rerouting traffic to avoid congestion. This effect is strongest in the Classic and Low capacity versions of the simulator due to their more powerful CvS curve. In addition to reducing congestion, this phenomenon also has a couple of other beneficial effects. In areas with a lot of commercial services, the spreading out of traffic means that more traffic passes by commercial services, which increases the number of customers for them, which in turn increases their desirability. In residential areas, the spreading out of traffic means that networks have lower average levels of traffic, which results in lower average traffic noise, which in turn results in higher desirability for the residences. The inverse of these effects does not happen (i.e., customer traffic is not lowered in previously congested areas when the congestion drops and traffic noise does not increase enough to make a difference when traffic spreads out to previously unused networks) due to the way the simulator is tuned. Due to the improvements in the pathfinder, abandonment due to commute time is even rarer than before in all capacity levels of the simulator. In the rare cases where it does occur, it tends to be minor, and tends to represent gaps in the city\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure, generally in the Education and Health areas. Looking at the Data Views for these sectors will typically show a deficit in one of these sectors in the area of abandonment, and building structures of the appropriate type in these areas should fix the problem. The maximum number of high wealth Sims that can live in a given city has increased substantially. Cities will see this increase only if they are well built and have the infrastructure to support a large number of high wealth Sims. Nevertheless, this change, which is also an effect of pathfinder optimization, gives the player options for city building that were not available before. Usage of well-built transit stations tends to be better, as the improved pathfinder is better at navigating its way through them. As the pathfinder improves, it is more sensitive to user actions in city construction. For example, if you want your Sims to use more mass transit, simply build more mass transit stations (and routes, if necessary). If you want your Sims to use your highways more, build more interchanges between your highways and other roadways. In these two cases, stations and interchanges may have to be placed closer together than in real life for maximum benefit, as the underlying mechanisms by which the game works are rather different from real life. For example, Sims try to take the fastest route in general, even if this means that they save only a few seconds in their commute. Normal real life constraints don\u0026rsquo;t apply to them, as they never have to wait for buses or trains to arrive, they never have to stop at intermediate stations, and they don\u0026rsquo;t even have to stop at stoplights. Sims are constantly on the move from the time they leave their homes until the time they arrive at their jobs. This results in a rather different commuting environment from what we are used to. Note that there is no \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; spacing of stations, bus stops, or highway interchanges; the best spacing depends on what usage patterns you want for your networks. Also, it\u0026rsquo;s important to know that Sims will walk arbitrarily far if necessary. The traffic simulator works most optimally in cities that have a reasonable number of streets, especially residential streets. Since this is how real life cities are built, this is just another way of saying that the traffic simulator works best in well built cities. Streets don\u0026rsquo;t have to comprise a majority of the roadways in the city; they just shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be rare. If you get a warning from the transportation advisor about not having enough streets, it is best to heed it. Other changes in the NAM Traffic Simulator from previous traffic simulators dating before 2011 (as well as from the original Maxis traffic simulator) include the following: # More realistic subway costs. Subways in Sim City are tremendously underpriced compared to the real world. The improvements to the pathfinder have made huge networks of subways less necessary, so the monthly cost for subway tiles has been multiplied by four to add a little more realism. More realistic air pollution due to traffic. Until now, the amount of air pollution emitted by traffic has been unchanged from the original game, where it was based on cities that had far less traffic capacity than that used by any of the recent traffic simulators. To keep the amount of air pollution emitted by traffic to a more realistic amount, the proportion of traffic air pollution to actual traffic has been lowered in the NAM Traffic Simulator. This lower proportion is linked to the Clean Air Act, so it is in effect only when the Clean Air Act is enabled. More accurate numbers for the Commute Time Graph. Due to a bug in the game, it is impossible to get accurate Commute Time Graph numbers for almost all situations. However, the NAM Traffic Simulator has adjusted the scaling of this graph to provide more accurate numbers for most situations. Improved intersection effects. Despite the appearance of stoplights at intersections, Sims don\u0026rsquo;t actually stop; they don\u0026rsquo;t even slow down unless congestion is present around the intersection. The NAM Traffic Simulator provides much more congestion around heavily-traveled intersections, thereby doing a better job of simulating stop lights and stop signs. These intersection effects also significantly aid the pathfinder in finding optimal routes; as mentioned above, congestion always makes the pathfinder work better. This particular feature may result in unexpected congestion showing up at intersections in the Congestion Traffic Data View. As this congestion is integral to the working of the pathfinder, it should be ignored by the player, other than to recognize where heavily used intersections exist. The transportation advisor may complain about these, but since he hasn\u0026rsquo;t done his homework and doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand how the NAM works, he should be ignored in this case. Greater Monorail and High Speed Rail (HSR) usage. Due to poor tuning of the original Maxis Traffic Simulator, Monorail and HSR usage was generally less than it should be, sometimes by quite a bit. The NAM Traffic Simulator compensates for this with improved pathfinding, which raises monorail and HSR usage to more appropriate levels. Monorail and High Speed Rail trains have been fixed to contribute to and be affected by traffic congestion, just like all other vehicles. This is essential for the pathfinder to work optimally. However, it also means that Monorail and High Speed Rail trains now contribute to vehicle air pollution. The Clean Air Act, mentioned in the second point above, helps compensate for this additional pollution. Greater highway usage. The traffic simulator has been tuned so that Sims use highways much more than ever before. This usage still tends to fall short of real world usage, though, due to the structure of the game. The amount of rapid transit available in a city will also have a big effect on highway usage. All mass transit speeds have been recalibrated to provide a more realistic simulation. Improved customer levels for businesses. Capacities and speeds of one-way roads have been raised to duplicate the real-world advantage of these roads. Street capacities have been raised so that they reflect the capacities implied by their speed limits. Simulator Versions # What are the different versions of the NAM Traffic Simulator, and how are they used? # The NAM Traffic Simulator comes in five capacity versions - Classic, Low, Medium, High, and Ultra. The name of the version refers to the network capacities in the simulator. The name \u0026ldquo;Classic\u0026rdquo; refers to the fact that the capacities are similar to those used in the original Maxis traffic simulator. The following is a list of the network capacities for each version of the simulator; all capacities are per tile (for two-tile networks such as the Avenue and Highways, multiply the value by 2):
Network Classic Low Medium High Ultra Street: 750 1500 2400 3600 7200 Road: 1200 2400 4000 6000 12000 Avenue: 1200 2400 4000 6000 12000 One-Way Road: 1800 3600 6000 9000 18000 Highway (Ground and Elevated): 3750 7500 12500 18750 37500 RealHighway: 3000 6000 10000 15000 30000 Subway/Elevated Rail/Ground Light Rail: 5000 10000 16000 30000 65200 Monorail/High Speed Rail: 5000 10000 16000 30000 65200 Rail: 5000 10000 16000 30000 65200 Vehicle Type Rail Passenger Train 140 Freight Train 105 Vehicle Type Ground/Elevated Light Rail/Subway Light Rail Train/Tram 115 Vehicle Type Monorail/High Speed Rail Monorail/High Speed Rail Train 225 Which simulator version is appropriate for a particular city depends primarily on three things: the population of the city, the amount of rapid transit (rails) available, and the type of simulator used. Less capacity is needed for lower population cities, but less capacity is also required for cities with a lot of rapid transit. Finally, as mentioned above, the Classic and Low capacity simulators use the best pathfinder, and will therefore give the best simulation results if they can be used. So pick a simulator version based on these three factors; if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be the right capacity, you can always switch it out for a different capacity version by rerunning the NAM installer. Experience has shown that in large cities, the effects of such a switch may take up to five years to fully manifest. You can tell when things have stabilized by looking at the Traffic Volume Graph in the following way: First, let the game run until there is a sudden shift in traffic patterns. Sometimes, this may take over a year. Then run the game until you go at least a full year without any sudden change in traffic patterns. At that point, the transition to the new capacity simulator is complete. All this can be done without any harmful effects to your city.
What happened to the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT)? # [Note: If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT) is, or if you don\u0026rsquo;t use it, you can skip this section.]
With the introduction of the new traffic simulator, the TSCT is simply no longer needed to tune the simulator. There are two reasons for this: First, the past year of working with the simulator continually emphasized that many properties affect the simulation as a whole, and not just the function that is documented for them. This means that many properties in the TSCT that were thought to be safe to modify actually are not, and modifying them will almost always degrade the performance of the simulator. Second, with the significant improvement in simulator pathfinding, some properties of the simulator have become self-tuning, and this makes the settings for them in the TSCT unnecessary.
Here is the disposition of the various fields in the TSCT, starting in the upper left:
Mass Transit Usage: This field is now always set to the Medium value; the actual wealth and transit distributions can be seen int the greyed-out boxes on the right, in the box labeled \u0026ldquo;Custom\u0026rdquo;. However, the label \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo; no longer applies to these values, as the increased flexibility of the new simulator allows the player to set the balance between car and mass transit simply by the way they build their transit systems. A city with lots of highways but little mass transit will encourage car usage, while a city with with lots of mass transit and few or no highways will encourage mass transit usage. Highway Bus Lanes: Contrary to the description of this field, checking its box does not increase bus usage. In fact, it degraded simulator performance slightly. Park \u0026amp; Ride: This is discussed in its own section below. Buses contribute to traffic: This property is always set in the simulator, as it is necessary for optimal operation of the pathfinder. Monthly Fares per Sim per Tile: For people who really want to modify these values, they can safely be changed in the same way that the Park and Ride feature can be changed, as described below. Monthly Costs per Network Tile: As with the previous property, these values can safely be changed in the same way that the Park and Ride feature can be changed. Network Traffic Capacities: These are now fixed in the five capacity levels listed in the table above. Choosing different capacities degrades the performance of the traffic simulator. Base Network Capacity: This is set when the NAM is installed. To change it, you need to run the NAM installer again. Customers/Traffic Noise Coefficient: This is set to the optimal value for each simulator capacity and should not be changed. Commute Time Graph Scaling Factor: This is set to its optimal value and should not be changed. Commute Trip Max Time: This is set to the optimal value for each simulator capacity and should not be changed. Network Capacity Multiplier: This field is obsolete, as only the five listed capacities are supported. Intersection Effect Multiplier: This is set to its optimal value and should not be changed. Vehicle Air Pollution: Changing the value of this field is no longer supported. Data View: For now, customization of these data views is no longer supported. Eventually, they should be supported in the NAM installer. Park \u0026amp; Ride # Park \u0026amp; Ride is an option that was only supported in the TSCT. Park and Ride changes the game slightly so that cars cannot reach their destination directly. Instead, those Sims who prefer to drive must park near some sort of mass transit station and then take mass transit to the stop closest to their workplace. From there, they must walk the rest of the way. For this to work well, you need to have an extensive mass transit system. You also need to build parking lots and/or parking garages near key mass transit stops; generally the best places are at the edges of your residential areas that are closest to your jobs. Or you could just build parking facilities near the Sims\u0026rsquo; jobs (the ones that come with buildings generally don\u0026rsquo;t count), but this really defeats the main purpose of Park and Ride.
The ability to enable the Park \u0026amp; Ride functionality will eventually be incorporated into the NAM installer. Until then, this feature can be enabled only by modifying the traffic simulator file directly. This can be done with Ilive\u0026rsquo;s Reader (0.9.3); you can find the manual for the Reader here. For basic operations, the Reader is easy to use.
To turn on the Park \u0026amp; Ride feature of the traffic simulator, open the Reader and click the Open button. Navigate to the folder containing your traffic simulator and select it. If only the \u0026ldquo;Name\u0026rdquo; column appears in the right pane, you will have to click on the first \u0026ldquo;Exemplar file\u0026rdquo; row in the left pane to make all the other columns in the right pane visible.
Next, you will have to edit the \u0026ldquo;Travel type can reach destination\u0026rdquo; property, which is about two thirds of the way down in the right pane. Double click on this property name, and a list of values will come up. The second one applies to cars; its value is 0x01. Click on this value, type a zero, and then hit Enter twice. The list of values should disappear and the second value for this property in the right pane should have changed from True to False. If it has, type Control-S to save your new simulator. Park and Ride is now enabled.
To disable Park \u0026amp; Ride, follow the same steps as above, except that in the list of values that pops up, the second value will be 0x00, and you need to change it to a one. Once you do that, thesecond value for the \u0026ldquo;Travel type can reach destination\u0026rdquo; property in the right pane should have changed from False to True. You can now save the simulator and exit.
The Monthly Fares per Sim per Tile and the Monthly Costs per Network Tile can be modified in a similar fashion; the first one of these is named \u0026ldquo;Income per tile by travel type\u0026rdquo; in the simulator. Note that when you select a property in the reader, some helpful information about that property is displayed in the little window at the bottom.
These three properties are the only ones in the traffic simulator that are safe to modify. Modifying other properties, especially those that interact with the pathfinder, will almost always degrade the performance of the traffic simulator. The NAM Team cannot support installations where properties other than the three described above have been modified.

This feature guide will cover all the possibilities currently available in the mod.
The documentation on this page is in progress. The contents of this document are undergoing revision and are subject to change. Flex Turn Lanes (FTL) # The FLEX Turn Lanes (FTLs) are the newest and fullest-featured implementation of turn lanes in the NAM. There are two ways to construct FLEX Turn Lanes: the \u0026ldquo;quick\u0026rdquo; method, using pre-assembled FLEX Piece configurations for various intersection types, and the \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; method, which utilizes a combination of Starter Pieces and FLEX Pieces for most construction options, combined with Drag Patterns for the construction of Slip Lanes. The \u0026ldquo;quick\u0026rdquo; method is easier for novice users and those looking for the fastest way to build a FLEX Turn Lane setup, while the \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; method allows for more configuration options, and finer control over one\u0026rsquo;s turn lane setups when compared to the \u0026ldquo;quick\u0026rdquo; method.
Installation # In order to install the FLEX Turn Lanes, select the \u0026ldquo;FLEX Turn Lanes (FTL)\u0026rdquo; checkbox, which is located under Additional Features and Customizations \u0026gt; Turn Lanes, and is visible after clicking the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; sign to expand the menu. This plugin does require that the Network Widening Mod (NWM) also be installed, as it is required for some features to function properly. For more information on installation, see the Installation Guide.
Type Nomenclature # The types of FLEX Turn Lane setups included are defined by a three-digit number. The first number is the number of dedicated \u0026ldquo;inside\u0026rdquo; turn lanes\u0026ndash;left turn lanes if traffic drives on the right, right turn lanes if traffic drives on the left. The second number is the number of \u0026ldquo;through\u0026rdquo; lanes on the base network for the given setup. The third number denotes the number of dedicated \u0026ldquo;outside\u0026rdquo; turn lanes\u0026ndash;right turn lanes if traffic drives on the right, left turn lanes if traffic drives on the left. (Presently, there are no setups with a third digit greater than zero; these setups may be added in a later release.)
Here is a listing of the types of FLEX Turn lanes currently available in the NAM, and their corresponding base networks:
Type 110 (Base: Road) (Single-Tile/1 Inside Turn Lane, 1 Through Lane, 0 Outside Turn Lanes): Road, NWM 3-Lane Turning Lane Avenue (TLA-3), NWM 2-Lane Avenue (AVE-2), NWM 3-Lane Asymmetrical Road (ARD-3) Also includes \u0026ldquo;Median\u0026rdquo; variant for use on T-intersections Type 120 (Base: Avenue or Road) (Dual-Tile/1 Inside Turn Lane, 2 Through Lanes, 0 Outside Turn Lanes): Avenue, NWM 5-Lane Turning Lane Avenue (TLA-5) Type 220 (Base: Avenue or Road) (Dual-Tile/2 Inside Turn Lane, 2 Through Lanes, 0 Outside Turn Lanes): Avenue, NWM 5-Lane Turning Lane Avenue (TLA-5) Type 130 (Base: Road) (Triple-Tile/1 Inside Turn Lane, 3 Through Lanes, 0 Outside Turn Lanes): NWM 6-Lane Avenue (AVE-6), NWM 7-Lane Turning Lane Avenue (TLA-7) In addition to these setups, Slip Lanes are also possible to add to not only FLEX Turn Lane setups, but also base Maxis networks and Network Widening Mod (NWM) override networks.
Effects on the Simulation # The Type 110 (non-Median) setups have the same capacity as the NWM\u0026rsquo;s TLA-3, AVE-2, and ARD-3 networks, by virtue of the use of Distilled Intersection Paths (DIPs) to boost per-tile capacity by 25% over that of the base network.
The Type 120 setups have the same capacity as an Avenue, with the caveat that traffic on the inner turn lane will be displaced from through traffic, thereby raising the capacity of through traffic (though potentially impacting traffic leaving the intersection).
The Type 220 setups have the same capacity as the NWM\u0026rsquo;s TLA-5 and RD-6 networks, by virtue of the use of Distilled Intersection Paths (DIPs) to boost per-tile capacity by 25% over that of the base network.
The Type 130 setups have the same capacity as the NWM\u0026rsquo;s TLA-7 and AVE-6 networks.
The Slip Lanes will draw traffic away from the through lanes before the intersection.
FLEX Turn Lane Content and Menu Navigation # The FLEX Turn Lane menu system is divided into two menu buttons: the QuickTurn button, used for constructing FLEX Turn Lanes using the quick method, and the FLEX Turn Lanes button, used for building FLEX Turn Lanes through the standard method.
The QuickTurn button contains the following menu items:
The FLEX Turn Lanes button contains the following menu items:
Building FLEX Turn Lanes # \u0026ldquo;Quick\u0026rdquo; Method using QuickTurn # The QuickTurn system is the quickest method to build FLEX Turn Lanes, though it does not cover all setups. In order to build a QuickTurn setup, simply select the appropriate setup from the QuickTurn button, TABing through the options to select the desired setup, and using Home/End to rotate. As QuickTurn setups are FLEX-based, one can always change the particulars of the turn lane configuration without necessarily having to bulldoze the entire setup and start again (as was the case with the old Turn Lane Extension Pieces).
\u0026ldquo;Standard Method\u0026rdquo; # The standard method for building FLEX Turn Lanes is much like the process of building standard NAM override network, though the \u0026ldquo;starters\u0026rdquo; for the FTLs are more like FLEX transitions, connecting networks to turn lane setups.
To build intersections using the Type 110 FLEX Turn Lanes, or using the multi-tile types (Type 120, 220, or 130) to intersect single-tile networks, simply select the desired type, then use the base network to extend the turn lane to the cross network. The turn lane override will end upon reaching a cross network, and to complete the intersection, one will need to place another FLEX Turn Lane starter on the opposite side, and drag through to complete the intersection.
Open image in new tab With Type 110 setups, when building T-intersections, one will need to use the Type 110 Median setup in order to complete the process, as continuing with the base Road network will create a jarring effect.
Open image in new tab In the case of building setups in which the FTL setup ends at a T-intersection with another network, or other factors with the design impact lane control (i.e. an intersection with a One-Way Road), the arrow setup on the turn lanes will automatically change to match the particular setup.
Open image in new tab Because the setups are FLEX-based rather than being predicated on static puzzle pieces, it is possible to \u0026ldquo;edit\u0026rdquo; the intersections after the fact without having to bulldoze the entire setup. For instance, the intersection above, with a Type 110 FTL ending at a Street, can be changed to end at a Road by simply dragging over the Street with the Road tool.
Open image in new tab When building intersections between two multi-tile networks, the FLEX Intersections must be used; simply dragging as with single-tile intersections will produce unpredictable and unstable results.
Each FLEX intersection has a base type\u0026ndash;for the dual-tile entries, the default is Type 120, whereas for the triple-tile entries, the default is Type 130. These defaults can be changed by dragging a different type into the ends. Note that with 4-way intersections, the side directly opposite it must also carry the same type, and asymmetrical setups are not possible. The conversion process is shown below, with the Type 120 approaches on the left and right approaches of the intersection being exchanged for Type 220 approaches.
Open image in new tab Building Slip Lanes # To build a Slip Lane, start branching off the network using the One-Way Road tool, by building a one-tile One-Way Road stub. Then, drag down from the One-Way Road stub with Road tool, as if to make a 90-degree bend off the stub to create the slip. The process is dependent on the drive-side one\u0026rsquo;s game uses (except in the case of slip lanes between two One-Way Roads, which can go either way). Both the RHD (traffic driving on the right) and LHD (traffic driving on the left) methods are shown below.
Open image in new tab It is also possible to build Right-In-Right-Out (RIRO, for RHD users) or Left-In-Left-Out (LILO, for LHD users) using the Slip Lanes. Construction of a RIRO setup in RHD is shown below; simply mirror the process to obtain a LILO in LHD.
Open image in new tab All of these features combined can allow for seemingly complex setups such as this to be created, entirely using FLEX and draggable components.
Open image in new tab Building Crossings With Rail-Type Networks # To build a crossing with a Rail-type network on a stretch of FLEX Turn Lane, simply drag the desired network through the FTL, just as one would do with a standard Maxis network or NAM override network. Provided the network is supported, the crossing should appear\u0026ndash;it\u0026rsquo;s really that simple! The image below shows how to build a RealRailway crossing through a FTL.
Open image in new tab Supported networks for crossings include the following. Note that only Orthogonal networks are supported at present.
RealRailway (RRW) Dual-Track Rail (DTR) RealRailway (RRW) Single-Track Rail (STR) RealRailway (RRW) L1 Dual-Track Rail (DTR) RealRailway (RRW) L2 Dual-Track Rail (DTR) Ground Light Rail (GLR) Elevated (Light) Rail Monorail High Speed Rail (HSR) A Note Regarding One-Way Road Intersections # FLEX Turn Lane setups involving One-Way Road intersections will only function properly if the arrows on the FTL are pointing such that they correspond to the direction of the One-Way Road, and in the case of 4-way intersections, is most stable if the One-Way Road is SITAP-enabled. The Network Widening Mod\u0026rsquo;s width variants of the One-Way Road network (OWR-1, OWR-3, OWR-4, and OWR-5) are not supported at present.
Unsupported Setups # The following setups are known to be unsupported by the current iteration of the FLEX Turn Lanes plugin, and will result in reversion to the underlying base network, and/or blocked traffic:
Any situation in which a FLEX Turn Lane Starter/Transition is placed immediately before an intersection. (At least one tile of the FLEX Turn Lane setup must exist between the Starter/Transition and the intersection.) Any intersection in which one or more network is diagonal or at a fractional angle. Any intersection involving three or more different base network types. Any intersection involving crossings with Light Rail Dual-Networking (Elevated or Ground). Any intersection with a Street Addon Mod override network (click-around may resolve this to a situation where the FTL blocks the SAM override). Any intersection involving the Avenue network without a FLEX Turn Lane override applied (either Type 120 or 220 at present) will not allow inside turns (left turns if driving on the right, right turns if driving on the left). (This may actually be a beneficial exploit in some cases, and future FLEX Turn Lane development will explore turn restrictions further.) Any intersection directly involving a Network Widening Mod (NWM) override network, that has not been converted into a FLEX Turn Lane setup beforehand. Networks that do not presently support transition into a FLEX Turn Lane setup (OWR-1, OWR-3, OWR-4, OWR-5, NRD-4, RD-4, and RD-6) cannot support intersections at present. The TLA-3/5/7 and ARD-3 may produce a largely functional result in the case of FLEX Intersection setups, and the AVE-2 and AVE-6 will produce a partially functional setup, with a restriction on inside turn lane functionality (similar to what the base Avenue network will do). Any situation in which a network with FLEX Turn Lanes curves before reaching an intersection. Any situation involving RealHighway (RHW) networks, either with at-grade/same-level intersections, or undercrossings. Any situation involving the Draggable Elevated Road Viaducts. Any situation in which a Static Puzzle Piece interrupts a FLEX Turn Lane override before it reaches an intersection. This includes the deprecated Turn Lane Extension Pieces (TuLEPs), the predecessor to the FLEX Turn Lanes. Any situation in which a Slip Lane is built right before a FLEX Turn Lane setup ends at a T-intersection. Any T-intersection in which the number of lanes on the ending network exceeds that of the through network (i.e. a Type 130 setup may not end at a T-intersection with a through Type 110 setup). Any intersection between a FLEX Turn Lane setup with two inside or outside turn lanes (i.e. Type 220) and a network with one travel lane per direction. Any intersection involving a One-Way Road (or NWM override thereof) in which the turn lanes on a FLEX Turn Lane setup would result into a turn into wrong-way traffic. Other Known Issues # Gaps may appear in wealth-level texturing when Slip Lanes are built on all four corners of a +-intersection, except in cases when the base Avenue network, or an override of it (i.e. a Type 120 or 220 FLEX Turn Lane setup) is used as one of the crossroads. There is no known solution to this aesthetic issue at present. One-Way Road Signalized Intersection and Turn Arrow Project (SITAP) # Due to how Maxis implemented the One-Way Road network\u0026rsquo;s directionality, locking it in a hardcoded tidal flow routine, the game\u0026rsquo;s Network Rule (RUL) systems (which are the bread and butter of what the NAM Team does) cannot tell the direction traffic is headed. As a result, the One-Way Road network, by default, does not have functioning traffic signals. The Signalized Intersection and Turn Arrow Project, or SITAP, is the NAM Team\u0026rsquo;s answer to that, using a series of simple Pattern-Based Draggable workarounds to not only signal-enable intersections involving One-Way Roads, but also provide turn arrow features, along the lines of what the FTL system provides. Currently, only Orthogonal x Orthogonal setups are supported.
The basic setup one would need to build depends on the cross network. A few scenarios for SITAP-enabling intersections are shown below. All of these are for 4-way intersections; simply omitting one leg will provide the pattern for a 3-way intersection. The setup for the Avenues (and FTL Type 120) shown below is also the pattern for crossing Road-based multi-tile NWM override networks, and the setup for Roads will also work with the Road-based single-tile NWM networks, as well as the Type 110 FTLs.
One-Way Road x One-Way Road # Open image in new tab One-Way Road x Road # Open image in new tab One-Way Road x Avenue # Open image in new tab One-Way Road x FTL Type 120 # Open image in new tab At present, only the base One-Way Road network features SITAP support. The Network Widening Mod width variants (OWR-1, OWR-3, OWR-4, and OWR-5) are not presently SITAP-enabled, though this functionality is planned for a future release. (A FLEX piece-based option is also under consideration.)
Old Content # The content below is only kept for legacy purposes in order to prevent the Network Addon Mod from breaking old save games. However, there is no guarantee that these implementations will continue to be available in future. It is strongly recommended that you use modern implementations of the below going forward.
Road Turning Lanes DEPRECATED # The old Road Turning Lanes (RTL) feature is still available, but due to interference from newer plugins, such as the Network Widening Mod, Draggable Elevated Road Viaducts, and Draggable Fractional Angle Roads, Road Turning Lanes no longer automatically appear when Road x Road intersections are built. This change has been in place since 2013, and there are no plans to bring back the automatic version.
The Road x Road intersection turn lanes can still be activated at intersections of one\u0026rsquo;s choosing by simply clicking over the intersection with the One-Way Road tool.
Open image in new tab Avenue Turning Lanes DEPRECATED # The old Avenue Turning Lanes (ATL) feature is also still available, and remains as an automatic setup when a 4-way orthogonal Avenue x Avenue intersection is constructed. Please note that having this feature installed may cause some stability issues with newer Avenue-related features.
Turn Lane Extension Pieces (TuLEPs) DEPRECATED # The Turn Lane Extension Pieces, or TuLEPs, are a series of puzzle pieces that allow for the construction of modular turn lane setups and slip lanes. The TuLEPs set in the NAM includes turn lane pieces for Roads and Avenues (which can also be used by some Network Widening Mod networks), and slip lane pieces for Roads, One-Way Roads and Avenues. There are two varieties of Turn Lane setups included, Type A (single left-turn lane/right-turn in LHD, included for Road and Avenue), and Type B (dual left-turn lanes/right-turn in LHD, included for Avenue), plus transitions to connect them to their base networks. It is highly recommended to first drag out the base layout of the intersection on which you\u0026rsquo;d like to have turn lanes, and then simply place the puzzle pieces on top of this. Because of the way in which the pieces had to be configured to allow them to be plopped over an existing network, it is highly recommended that one avoid using the bulldozer tool after \u0026ldquo;mistakes\u0026rdquo;, as it can create a \u0026ldquo;cascade\u0026rdquo; that will require more rebuilding. Most TuLEPs puzzle pieces of the same base network type can be plopped over top of one another, and it is advised that one take this approach instead.
The Turning Lane (TuLEP) Puzzle Pieces Menu button (found on the Roads Menu) contains the following Puzzle Pieces:
Road Type A Transition/T-End Transition Road Type A1/A2 Road Type A-Blank and A-Dashed Road Type A Compact Transition Avenue Type A/B Transition Avenue Type A1/A2 Avenue Type A-Blank1/Blank 2 Avenue Type B1 Avenue Type B-Blank Road Type A +/T Intersection Avenue Type A +/T Intersection Avenue Type B + / AB + Intersection Avenue/Road Type A +/T Road Type AxDTR / STR Road Type AxGLR Avenue Type AxDTR Avenue Type AxSTR Avenue Type AxGLR 1-Tile Slip Lane Road Slip Lane Road Dual Slip Lane OWR Slip Lane Avenue Slip Lane Road Type A/Slip Lane Road Type A/Dual Slip Lane Road T-End Slip Lane Avenue Type A/Slip Lane Avenue Type A/Dual Slip Lane NWM TLA-3/AVE-2-Road Type A Transition Additional TuLEPs for the TLA-7 and AVE-6 networks in the Network Widening Mod can be found under their own \u0026ldquo;Triple-Tile TuLEPs\u0026rdquo; button.

On the Rails Menu # Underground Rail, Rail Tunnel under Roads Dual Networking PiecesThis button contains the base URail portal, as well as all of the various parallel Road-over-URail Dual Network items. Underground Rail, Rail Tunnel under PedMalls Dual Networking PiecesThis button contains all of the various parallel PedMall-over-URail Dual Network items. Underground Rail Maxis Roadway Intersection PiecesThis button contains perpendicular crossings over URail for all of the base Road and Highway-type transportation networks in the game (Road, Street, One-Way Road, Avenue, Ground Highway, and Elevated Highway) Underground Rail Maxis Railway Intersection PiecesThis button contains perpendicular crossings over URail for all of the base Rail and Mass Transit-type transportation networks in the game (Rail, Elevated Light Rail, and Monorail), as well as under the NAM's Single-Track Rail (STR) override network and Rail Viaducts. Underground Rail Maxis Miscellaneous Puzzle PiecesThis button contains miscellaneous URail items, including URail 4-way Rail Intersections (basically, FURLs from the ESURE, or Express Subways and Underground Rail Extensions), often under various other networks and intersections in a Dual Network format. On the Misc. Transit Menu # Underground Rail Maxis Tramway Intersection PiecesThis button contains perpendicular crossings over URail for Ground Light Rail (GLR)/Tram, as well as Tram-on-Street (TOS) and Tram-in-Avenue (TIA). (Tram-in Road (TIR) and Tram-on-Road (TOR) are not presently supported.) Note that there presently is no crosslinkage to support crossings under (or Dual-Networking with) any RealHighway (RHW), Network Widening Mod (NWM), or Street Addon Mod (SAM) networks, or with Road Viaducts.
Building A URail System # To build a URail system, first hook a Rail line into a URail portal (or Rail Tunnel Ramp), found at the end of the Underground Rail, Rail Tunnel under Roads Dual Networking Pieces (the first URail button on the Rails Menu). Pressing Shift-TAB (or Ctrl-Shift-TAB on Mac) will take you right to the portal. To return to ground level with your line, simply place another URail portal/Rail Tunnel Ramp at the desired location.
As there are no base URail pieces under blank terrain, if you wish to continue your URail line under effectively blank terrain without having another network parallel overhead, use the PedMall-over-URail pieces, found under the Underground Rail, Rail Tunnel under PedMalls Dual Networking Pieces button for such cases. Orient the Rail textures shown in the preview to fit with the intended direction of your URail line.
Hovering over top of a URail piece with one of the game\u0026rsquo;s Query Tools will show a Rail \u0026ldquo;ghost texture\u0026rdquo;, allowing you to discreetly see where your URail line is located.
To cross under an above-ground network, use the appropriate intersection or miscellaneous piece, and align the preview model\u0026rsquo;s Rail textures with your URail line.
Alternatively, to start a segment of Dual Networking, build the appropriate Dual-Networking intersection piece, and then continue with the parallel Dual-Networking pieces as appropriate.
Limitations # Due to game limitations with the Train transit types, a draggable implementation similar to Subway-based FLUPs is unfortunately not currently feasible. A Rail-based draggable would alter terrain above ground in undesirable ways. Note that due to the game\u0026rsquo;s limitation of two true networks on a single tile, intersections above a URail line can only be of a single network, since URail is itself Rail-based. Any Dual-Networking setup must be with a network type other than Rail (i.e. Road). Rail-over-URail Dual-Networking is not possible, due to the prospects of path jumping (in which case a Train could jump between above and below ground). `}),e.add({id:45,href:"/docs/tech-specs/understanding-rul-flags/",title:"Understanding RUL Flags",description:"This document provides information about common flags used in the game by the NAM to create a variety of FLEX and other puzzle pieces.",content:`RUL files control the placement of network items in the game. An example of a network item is the road you drag out. RUL flags refer to a specific combination of hexadecimal values that tell each network tile what to do.
Understanding Flags # Basic Flags # Network flags are the game\u0026rsquo;s encoding of transit network connections for a given tile. Each tile has four flags, one for each edge. A flag defines whether a connection exists across an edge and its relative direction.
Five primitive flags are used in the various RUL files:
0 - no connection 1 - left diagonal 2 - orthogonal 3 - right diagonal 4 - median (for double-width networks, e.g. avenue) Individual Network RULs make use of additional flags:
11 - left diagonal to orthogonal blend 13 - right diagonal to orthogonal blend Rail networks use additional complex flags:
21 - left diagonal switch 23 - right diagonal switch 22 - left secondary blend 42 - right secondary blend 32 - left orthogonal to diagonal crossover/switch 52 - right orthogonal to diagonal crossover/switch 62 - wye flag (also used for crossover/switch) 72 - \u0026lsquo;W\u0026rsquo; flag (used for \u0026lsquo;W\u0026rsquo; switches) Individual Network RUL (INRUL) # Individual network RULs define the standalone behavior of the game\u0026rsquo;s twelve networks. Each network has a basic and advanced INRUL file. Basic INRUL defines typical placement, while advanced INRUL handles more complex situations.
INRULs are composed in a 5x5 grid of tiles in which flags and network piece IDs are defined. Conventionally, basic INRUL uses only tile to define a rule, while advanced INRUL defines multiple tiles.
Intersection Solutions RUL (RUL1) # RUL1 defines tiles for the intersections between two different network types.
Override RUL (RUL2) # RUL2 is used to override the results of INRUL and RUL1 definitions. It works by reassigning a pair of adjacent pieces to another pair, replacing one or both pieces. RUL2 is the mechanism used to create override networks such as SAM or RHW.
Intersection Ordering RUL (RUL0) # RUL0 defines interchanges, puzzle pieces and FLEX-style pieces which can be placed using menu buttons.
